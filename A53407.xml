         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know you expect I ſhould be as good as my word, and truly ſo I will to the utmoſt of my poor power, becauſe of the great regard I have for your Perſon, Cauſe, and Intereſt; and before I enter upon any more lines of your ſweet face, in order to perfect your Picture, let us take a diſh of drink together, and give you a true ſtate of your intereſt here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and when we conſider the excellent qualifications of your Hell-born Crew here, you may eaſily conclude what a naſty pickle you and my old Landlady are in; and that I ſhall do in theſe ſix particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your Cattel here have acted their parts, in tampering to make parties againſt the preſent Government, which parties were to have been made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your Friends or your Enemies; the former are ſuch a parcel of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Raſcals, that, to tell you the truth, as they quitted your Father in the time when he had moſt occaſion for them, ſo they did you; witneſs your friends both here and in <hi>Scotland</hi> too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding the application they made by your eſpecial direction to Sir <hi>Timothy Stiff-Jaws,</hi> when old <hi>Preſton</hi>'s hopeful deſign was baffled by the vigilance of the preſent Government, nay, I doubt not but that they might by <hi>Scotch Robin</hi> have made ſome effort of that nature upon ſome of our Diſſenters; but alas, it was to no purpoſe, for they underſtood their Intereſt (as well as an old friend of yours did of cheating your Brother of a tickling ſumm, you know for what uſe) and therefore all attempts (if ever any) were to all intents and purpoſes fruitleſs and vain; well, I pray what tools did you make uſe of, very ſorry ones upon my word, a ſort of people whoſe perſons were neither known, nor had they credit for a two-penny Loaf; perſons not able to make you a party worth the mentioning, nor can I (by the beſt enquiry I can make) tell who ſet them on work, or what Warrant or Authority they have for what they do, for if one ſhould ask Sir <hi>Timothy Stiff-Jaws,</hi> to whom (as I ſaid before) they were to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, he would ſwear by my Landlady's white hand, that he knew never a Rogue of them all, and would not loſe his good Preferment as long as there was a ſhilling to be got, though I muſt tell you, that in ſpight of the Whore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95393:4"/>
his neighbour, he hath quitted his Poſt ſince a penny could not be got in it with any great matter of content: he is now at Graſs, and waits, dear Sir, for a comfortable minute, that he may have my Landlady by the hand again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance. I ſuppoſe he might make you under-hand half a dozen poor Curs, and theſe the Rogues call a Party, and a Party for you, and upon the ſtrength of theſe Fellows impudence, your nonſenſical Crew ſhamm'd a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Declaration from you, bearing date from <hi>St. Germains,</hi> which did you more hurt than the Fiſhermen of <hi>Feverſham</hi> could do for their hearts blood: Well, when your gracious Declaration came, Lord! What a ſtir they made with it, and publiſh it they would, hand over head, without any regard had for the Publiſhers and diſpoſers of the ſame, or the leaſt thought of making any proviſion for thoſe willing Vermin, that lay at the mercy of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be drawn, hang'd and quartered, for ſuch an eminent piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and ſome of them have taken a civil ſwing, tho much ado before they could be perſwaded to it.</p>
            <p>You was not pleaſed to put us off with one Declaration, but a ſecond and a third was iſſued forth, bearing date from <hi>St. Germains,</hi> in which you loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared what great and good things they ſhould have, the Lord knows when, if they would but meet you the Lord knows where: But, I pray Sir, why did you reflect upon the ingratitude of ſome of your old Friends? Alas! alas! you did not well conſider that they might be got into good employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which they were to Battle their ſweet Bodies for a convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or it may be if ſome of them had been ſo ſcandalous that they could not get into an employment of conſiderable truſt, they were got behind the Hangings, with a comfortable Penſion, to the end that they may uſe King <hi>William</hi> in that Poſt, as they did you when you employed them: Nay, ſweet Sir, now I think on't, there is your old Friend Sir <hi>Simkin</hi> you know, who turned Whig to betray the Whigs to your Brother, and then he turned Tory to betray your Brother to the Whigs, then turned Papiſt to betray your good Worſhip; what could you do with ſuch a Spark if he ſhould take the other turn, but keep him behind the Hangings, to do ſome job or another, tho it coſt you two or three thouſand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for Secret ſervice; for in my conſcience Rhiming <hi>Jack Carryl,</hi> and the reſt of your doughty Crew at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> would ſcarce ſit at Council-board with him, he would be ſo ſcandalous; he ſaith he is a man of good parts, and wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d himſelf ſign a Certificate even upon Oath, ſince honour hath ſo long been a ſtranger to him, yet none of your poor humble Curs now with you, would be ſeen in his company for forty ſhillings a man, leſt he ſhould betray you once more. Come, let me ask you one civil queſtion, if you ſhould be King of <hi>Poland,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Uſhant,</hi> or <hi>Bell Iſle?</hi> Would you ever admit him ſo much as Clerk of your Kitchen; truly you muſt have the Grace of a great deal of good Nature, to believe him worthy of ſuch an Employ; for ſince he hath made ſo many turns, let him have nothing with you but that of a Turnſpit, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too lend for any elſe; yet for all this, this Caſe-hardened Coxcomb, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95393:4"/>
brags of doing great feats for the ſupport of our Government, hath pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch an Intereſt with you, and my very good Landlady, that one would think that he was ready to make another turn, and ſome of your Cattle here would fain make us believe he is doing you ſervice. For my part I don't, but if you believe it, you may then imagine, that by him you may accompliſh your reſtoration, without putting your friend <hi>Lewis</hi> to the charge of an hard Onion or a round Coal in the ſaid ſervice; if they cannot rely upon him, the fools will brag that they have ſome friends that are in place. I confeſs I do ſee ſome of your old Villains yet employed, but the boaſt that is made by your Crew of their aid and aſſiſtance is rather noiſie than dangerous; I am more affraid of the men of Brains, Quality and Reſerve, that manage in the dark, I am ſure we cannot be too wary of ſuch Inſtruments. I looked upon Sir <hi>Timothy Stiff-Jaws</hi> and Sir <hi>Formal</hi> the younger to be more dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for your ſervice, than ever Sir <hi>Simkin</hi> could pretend to be; and they would have appeared in their colours, could your old hanged Exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have carried his point, for you know four thouſand Horſe at command is a pretty Poſt, and might have done ſomething, I'll aſſure you, towards your changing your <hi>French</hi> air, of which I ſuppoſe you are pretty weary: But what next, what are we to do now? Truly ſince Betraying and Plotting is pretty well out of faſhion, Sir <hi>Simkin</hi> ſets up a Mercury Office to help men to places, and values himſelf much upon his laſt calling; how long the trade will laſt I can't tell, but if I thought it would hold any conſiderable time, I would put a friend of mine an apprentice to him for ſeven years, provided he might be free of the Trade when he comes out of his time.</p>
            <p>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ll warrant you now that you have a great deſire to know of Sir <hi>Simkin</hi>'s good health, and when I ſaw him: Truly Sir, I ſee him often; and he hath his health well, but he hath left off the uſe of his Beads; and leaving them off at an unſeaſonable time, it was of ſome prejudice to the little reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had amongſt ſome of your friends; as for Mother Church, ſhe hath left him as an out-caſt, and what game he is playing, the Dee'l and <hi>John a Cumber</hi> knows beſt: his office doth take pretty well as I hear, I have not had occaſion to make uſe of him, you may have a caſt of his Office if you will truſt him again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am to obſerve a ſecond thing to you, concerning your willing friends here, and that relates to their Pamphlets, which I muſt tell you, Sir, are ſpitefully dangerous; that it is death to touch them, and ſo dear and tedious to ſpread them, that they are of little or no uſe to your Cauſe and Intereſt: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Scotch Robin's Great Britains, Groans by reaſon of the depredation of the Dutch:</hi> The lying Raſcal ſhould have confeſſed, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been very remiſs on the one hand, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> very diligent on the other; that hath been indeed the cauſe of our decay, and their intereſt in Trade; but the Book (had not there been too much of it) was only to rail at King <hi>William</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s ſuppoſed miſ-management of his Affairs, and thereby he would imply that he was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; but the Rogue durſt not for his Ears ſay; that King <hi>VVilliam</hi> was an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95393:5"/>
for if he had, he might have been hanged for his pains, without Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>VVilkinſon</hi>'s interpoſition to ſave him: But you may imagin, that it may be for your ſervice to have King <hi>William</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s management of his Affairs expoſed to the ſcorn and contempt of the World. Well, ſuppoſe it be, I believe he doth as little value it, as the <hi>Feverſham</hi> men did your Worſhip, when they clapt your Arſe. I do not find he is afraid to let a Parliament inſpect his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thanks be to God, he lets them have time enough to call delinquents to an Account; but how in the name of an old Oyſter-wench is this for your ſervice? For to publiſh his miſcarriages (to the world) would be a notorious reflexion upon your Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Government and yours; for your Scribblers, as <hi>Scotch Robin,</hi> and his friend old <hi>Hodge,</hi> and his inferiour crew, writing againſt K. <hi>VVilliam</hi> for the cauſe aforeſaid, they write againſt you, and directly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſweet ſelf, in compliment to <hi>James Stuart,</hi> late of <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer. Theſe fellows when they write of our King <hi>William,</hi> they arraign him as a Tyrant, with little or no imputation upon him as an Uſurper; ſo that the clamour they make is about his Male adminiſtration; ſo that tacitely they admit of his Authority, and ſo wound you through his ſides. In a word, all they drive at is, that our King is not ſo good a man as your ſweet ſelf.

            <p>But, Sir, ſee what a pack of Raſcals you rely upon, ſince all the ſubjects on which they treat, and propoſitions in their Books by them laid down, are as contrary to the intereſt they pretend to, as light is to darkneſs, nay <hi>Simkin</hi> himſelf could not have done your buſineſs more effectually, than theſe ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels have done it, for here they betray your Title and Honour, and ſink your Prerogative, that if ever you ſhould return, you would not have enough to piece the knees of your Breeches withal, and that would be a ſad thing, my friend, to have that Royal buſineſs reduced to ſo low an ebb<hi>:</hi> ſurely theſe men are in hopes of Sir <hi>Simkin</hi>'s getting them places<hi>:</hi> They write ſo wickedly for you, and as little to the purpoſe, as if they were diſpoſed rather to ſix you in <hi>Rome,</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> what is this but betraying you, and betraying is betraying, let it be to <hi>St. Germains</hi> or the <hi>Hague,</hi> it's all one in the Original.</p>

nay, they meat and drink it away as if the 80000 Pound that was forgiven to Sir <hi>John,</hi> had been divided amongſt them to make them hearty merry; in truth, Sir, their Expences one time were ſo laviſh, that one would have thought that a Band of Penſioners had ſat at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> and that <hi>Greaſy Guts</hi> had been Speaker, to have ſupplied their extraordinary occaſions, and that you had entruſted your Brothers old friend with t'other two hundred thouſand pound, too be paid to them for ſecret ſervice.</p>
            <p>Truly, Sir, this they call ſecret ſervice, and very well they may, good men, for it's all over ſecret, only their Character, Names, Places of Abode, their Perſons and their Buſineſs are known; we could and can eaſily find them, and take them up when we pleaſe, without the charge of a <hi>Kingſton</hi> or a <hi>Fuller</hi> to diſcover them, the former you will do well to return to his Trade of a Taylor, and the latter to that of a Coney-wool-cutter: You will ſay what is this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton?</hi> Truly, Sir, an humble poor Cur of yours, that a friend of yours in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Court helped to the uſe of a Pulpit in the Dioceſs of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where the good man exerciſed his Talent, and run down the Popiſh Plot with all the ſhreds of Learning he had; in time the Bp. of the Dioceſs came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this fellow had never been ordained by either Bp. or Presbyter, but that he had been only a broken Taylor, that had impudence enough without any colour of Law to get up into the Pulpit; the Bp examined the matter, and diſmiſſed my Spark from his preaching. Well, what then? Truly the next thing he took up was to be a Spy upon a Party, to betray them, as if Sir <hi>Simkin</hi> had laid his hands upon him for that purpoſe, without the help of a <hi>Scotch</hi> Bp. here, and truly there was no manner of need of his ſervice, for your Crew were as ſecret as Noon-day; had theſe people managed as your Jeſuits managed with you the Popiſh Plot, we had then ſtood in need of forty Spies, whereas in your laſt managed deſigns there was no need of one, for every man did ſo plainly ſee the fooliſh behaviour of your Conſpirators, that they muſt have been blind had they not ſeen their deſigns</p>

            <p>But you ſay, what would men have you to do? Truly I have nothing for you to do, but to recollect with your ſelf what a ſet of Rogues you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd on, and they have all failed you, and above all, to call to mind how they pretended Loyalty to you, tho they knew you aſcended the Throne by fraud, perjury, violence, and murther; and when you were driven from us, they ſtruck in with the Government of a Prince, that aſcended the Throne by the voice of the people, and pretend to have a great eſteem for his Juſtice, and Valour, but in truth, it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s for the Money-getting imployments they have met withal; I ſay remember theſe things, and if you had but a grain of ſenſe, you would do that to you ſelf, you cauſed to be done to the truly noble, and never to be forgotten Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

            <p n="4">4.

Do but obſerve how theſe Vermin live in a great meaſure by ſpunging upon your ſweet Self, or your credulous friends; nay rather than the Rogues will be idle, they will fall into Diſtreſs to be helped out again, and ſpend what they get, in guttling and fuddling; and as for thoſe that have done you good ſervice, they ſham off, with a God-damn ye.</p>

And are theſe things ſo? Yes, truly, and ſo they will be, as long as they have an unfortunate Prince, for whoſe Cauſe they contend; and as long as they are managed by thoſe whoſe Loyalty conſiſts in Drinking and Swearing, and Whoring too, or elſe they would not be liked of. They now and then will make a man of ſome Figure privy to their Intreague, then, poor Cur, in his own defence, he is forced to maintain them, juſt as you did your <hi>Iriſh</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in half pay, that they might not make ſwear upon you in your Brother's time. Some there are whoſe Eſtates have been ſhrunk for the curioſity of knowing a dangerous ſecret: Moreover, this can be made out in due time, that not one Letter in ten of your Rogues ever miſcarried, and ſcarce a man of them was taken up, till the buſineſs of the Aſſaſſination was diſcovered, tho the ways of their Correſpondence, their Perſons, their Haunts, and their pretended Buſineſs, hath been as well known to the Government, as they themſelves are to one another. Theſe are a pretty ſort of managers I aſſure you, they commit as many Soliciſms in plotting, as <hi>Tom Jenner</hi> uſed in his Speech-making, or as <hi>Wright</hi> in his Law. What you are out of order now, and ſeem very much diſpleaſed: Come, come, I pray, come over into <hi>England,</hi> and look after theſe Rogues, and that you may not be diſcovered, do but look and act the part of a Wiſe and Honeſt Man, and then no body will know you, and then you may repaſs without the danger of the <hi>Feverſham</hi> men's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt ſtroke at your poſteriors; but I doubt you will not have the courage of coming to us, though you had the courage to run from us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be ſome expedient found out, for the keeping theſe Rogues in order, or they will make you and your Commiſſions cheap; and not only ſo, but they will be in no condition to do that Miſchief, you have graciouſly deſigned for them to accompliſh; and not only ſo, but they will hinder and keep off others, of more ſenſe, and better intereſt, and might be of more uſe to you and danger to your Enemies: Come, for all your ſwearing, what I tell you is of greater weight it may be, than you are aware of. Come what think you of Squire <hi>Boldface,</hi> he is in the ſame poſt you left him; he was an active Rogue for you in the time of your Tyranny, and would have done what you had bidden him; I pray try him at this time, he lives near old Sir <hi>John</hi>'s, he may chance to put you in a way to Govern theſe Rogues at a better rate, or elſe our Pottage will be all ſpoiled, and then what will my Landlady ſay, I would not be in your coat for forty good Cherry-ſtones: You know this <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> is a pretty fellow, and hath all the qualifications of a Rogue, that can do you ſome ſervice in this affair, and if he fail you, you will do well to ſend for them to <hi>St. Germains,</hi> for they will certainly defeat all your glorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings for the honour of the Nation.</p>
            <p>I pray be not in ſuch haſte, but ſtay and take a little good advice, for alas, I have buſineſs of very very great weight to diſcourſe with you, therefore ſit down, for we muſt not loſe a Hog for want of a little Tar.

Enemies to the Court, and theſe they call <hi>Jacobites,</hi> but alas they are much out in their calculation, for theſe are but a ſort of Grumblers for want of a little Court Holy-water, and are no more <hi>Jacobites</hi> than my ſelf, though my Penſion hath been kept from me theſe five years, and ſome of them kept out of their expectations from this Government eight; ſo that they reckon all to be your friends that are angry with the Government, that have not had the opportunity of ruining of it, as your Cattel would willingly have done, if they had been taken into it<hi>:</hi> Oh! that you were but here with a wiſe head, and an honeſt heart, that no body might know you, to hear them talk of Deſcents, and bodies of <hi>Jacobites</hi> to cover them, you would ſplit your ſides with laughing at their extravagant folly; for if you were to have twenty thouſand louſie <hi>French</hi> Curs to land here, they could not expect to be covered, unleſs they covered one another, as <hi>Tumble-down Dick</hi> would have covered the Bookſellers Boy, or a ſweet-faced young Gentleman yet alive to tell the ſtory; ſuch a covering they might have met withal, but as for any other covering, they know nothing of the matter; nay, my old friend, I ſuppoſe they have ſent over their Emiſſaries to invite you, and to tell you they are ready; truly ſo they are, ſome are ready to ſtarve, and ſome are ready to be hanged, and others of them are ready with your ſweet ſelf to run away, and truly I am ready to dye with laughing when I ſee their management.</p>
            <p>Come, come, to deal plainly with you, theſe can neither fight nor cover, but in that way I mentioned, for they are purely for Paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance, and will no more fight than your Army did at <hi>Hounſlow-Heath,</hi> or at <hi>Salisbury;</hi> the Rogues will not ſhew any Courage, unleſs it be that of <hi>Tom Jenner,</hi> or your ſweet ſelf, valiantly to run away: In ſhort, they are a pack of Rogues, that are in a direct faction againſt the more ſober ſort of Jacobites, and give falſe Characters of them aboard, and calumniate them at home, as diſcouragers of all Loyal deſigns, as they call their naſty ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel Plots, when, in truth, they have only ſhamm'd themſelves to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and by their vain and villanous attempts they have expoſed themſelves as a raſcally Generation of people, that will not be content under any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for if they had you here again, thoſe very men would be the firſt that would fly, not only in yours, but alſo in my poor Landlady's face; God bleſs her, and keep the poor Gentlewoman on the other ſide the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſcratch her Eyes out, rather than they would ſtand idle for want of buſineſs, and ſend you and her, and the little Cub, a Grazing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time: Therefore I humbly conceive that your Cauſe is upon its laſt Legs, unleſs theſe men have ſome better way than is yet known to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

truth, and nothing but the truth, that they depoſe you their pretended King, in the very conditions upon which they ſay they would have you reſtored, for they would make you accountable to them, or elſe good night <hi>Nicholas:</hi> But what a ſwearing do you make, and will in ſpight of Hell it ſelf have them to be underſtanding men. Well, be quiet, I will ſay ſo too, and there is good reaſon for it: For in their labouring to reſtore you, they good men, only think to accompliſh an impoſſibility; and above, all they neither underſtand the ſtate of the Nation, nor the humour of the people, nor the meaſures of Government, nor the complication of Intereſts and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor ſo much as the root of the Diſeaſe, much leſs the Remedy: but to pleaſe you, they ſhall be men of intelligence, becauſe they get in to the moſt public Coffee-houſes about the Town, and therefore they cannot want for News, and News-letters; and upon the ſtrength of <hi>Dyer</hi>'s Letters, they ſet up for men of buſineſs and intreague, and they aſſume to themſelves the Government of the whole Province of Jacobitiſm. Oh, what under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers you have had for Levies, Aſſociations, Parliaments, Councils.

drawn, as to make no room for a Reſerve; but the truth of it is, you and he had ſo often violated your Words and Oaths, that ſuch Declarations would only have ſerved for Bum-fodder, and would have ſignified as little as your pimping Manifeſto's did to the Popiſh and Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>1. I will ſhew you what was done in order to the encouraging men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake and engage in this deſign; the deſign beſpoke it ſelf for nothing but a curſed Jeſuit and men of the ſame principles, who might to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, be the more paced in this holy undertaking of that vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous party: The Jeſuits, that in conjunction with your ſelf, and wicked party of Papiſts and Popiſhly affected perſons, undertook this affair. You know, Sir, that you no ſooner was by the providence of God, and the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of the people of <hi>England,</hi> reſtored to the Land of your Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Popiſh party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began to beſtir themſelves for the reſtoration of their Religion, therefore they apply themſelves to the Jeſuits, and Jeſuited Prieſts, and men of Arbitrary principles, and proteſted their zeal for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95393:10"/>
Reſtoration of the Catholic Religion, but they durſt not enter upon any deſign in the years 1660 and 1661, till they were ſure how the Parliament would ſteer their Courſe, in relation to the uniformity of ſervice here in <hi>England,</hi> who ſhould carry the point, whether the Biſhops or the Diſſenting Proteſtants, and therefore it was reſolved by the Jeſuits that nothing ſhould for that preſent time be undertaken, but the drawing in of ſome men into Conſpiracies, and to provide Rogues luſtily and heartily to ſwear Treaſon againſt them, in order to the deſtruction of ſome, and to bring others into diſrepute with the Parliament, that they might be kept under by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Laws that might be made againſt them, to the end, that they might be in no condition to give any oppoſition to them in their deſigns, that ſhould be by them formed for the effecting ſo bleſſed a work; beſides all this, they at that time were not ſure of your Countenance, becauſe for ſeveral years you made a ſort of profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, according to the uſage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with the King your Brother; and he himſelf was not married, and they thought it convenient that nothing ſhould be ſo much as propoſed, till they might have the countenance of ſome Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, and then it was thought that they might act the more ſafely, if the King could be engaged in a War againſt the Dutch, which they longed for with much impatience. But, Sir, I muſt deſcend into ſome particulars, and therefore I will undertake theſe two things. 1. I will put you in mind of what happened to encourage the Popiſh Party in undertaking their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous deſigns againſt the Proteſtant Religion and Government. 2. I will ſhew you what encouragements you and your Popiſh Councellors gave to your party to undertake the ſame.</p>
            <p>1. I will put you mind of what happened to encourage the Popiſh Party in undertaking of their villainous deſigns againſt the Proteſtant Religion and the Government, and this is neceſſary to be done, that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how you and your party have treated this Nation by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, for the reſtoring your Brother to his Throne, and you to your Native Country, which, well conſidered, we may ſee what a Bleſſing you both were to this Nation. Therefore, Sir, obſerve.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Argument againſt the Bill of Excluſion was, that it would have led the Parliament to attempt other great and conſiderable Changes, and thereby endangered the whole Government, and the peace of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now, what your Villains would have had the Nation to underſtand by this change, is worthy conſideration. Therefore, firſt, if by a change they meant a change of the conſtitution of the Government, let me tell you, that he could never have forged a more villainous Lye, than thoſe wicked Wretches did, that they might in conjunction with you inſtil ſuch thoughts into the mind of the King, as might effectually alienate his Soul from the uſe of Parliaments. It is evident, even to theſe <hi>Holbourn</hi> Wretches, that there was no Vote or Propoſition in either of theſe Parliaments, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95393:11"/>
could give any ground for ſuch a malicious reflection, and thefore in this matter, we that were lookers on might reaſonably charge your Brother and you, and your whole party, with a malicious deſign againſt all Parliaments, in thus arraigning the whole body of the Nation, upon theſe ill grounded and malicious ſuggeſtions. I am ſure this did not become the grandeur and juſtice of Princes, nor was agreeable to the meaſures of Prudence and Wiſdom, by which you ſhould have governed your ſelves. And Now, Sir, I will give the true reaſon why you thus delighted in theſe men, <hi>viz.</hi> your hating Parliaments, being afraid they ſhould have called you and them to account for your high Crimes and Miſdemeanors by this means, together with the inclinations of your dear Brother, you ſo ſway d him, that you could never want grounds to diſſolve not only three ſuch Parliaments, but threeſcore, if there had been occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, Sir, if you and your admirers had underſtood by attempting great and important changes, that the Parliament would have beſought the King, that you might no longer have the Government in your hands; that your villainous Conſpirators ſhould no longer preſide in his Councils, nor poſſeſs all the great Offices of Truſt in the Kingdom, that our Ports, Garriſons, and Fleet ſhould no longer be governed by thoſe that were at your Devotion; that marks of Favour and characters of Honour ſhould no more be placed upon ſuch as the wiſdom of the Nation had adjuſted favourers of Popery, or Penſioners to the <hi>French</hi> King: Theſe, I muſt confeſs, were great and important changes, ſuch as became <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants to believe were deſigned by thoſe Parliaments, and would have been by any other Parliament your Brother ſhould have called in his time, and ſuch as the people of <hi>England</hi> would have prayed for, and left the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Almighty God, who governs the hearts of Kings and Princes. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without theſe changes, the Bill of Excluſion would have ſignified little; it might have provoked, but not have diſabled your wicked party: Nay, the money the Nation muſt have paid for it, would have been uſed to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten your return upon us.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another Argument uſed againſt the Bill of Excluſion was, your great Grace and Favour for your Country, and the excellency of your Temper and Vertue. Surely, Sir, if you heard theſe men magnify you for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſonal qualifications, you would have ſpit in their Faces, and told them they ly'd; for the violence of your natural Temper, was ſufficiently Known, and your vehemency in exalting the prerogative in your Brother's Reign beyond its due bounds; and the principles of your curſed Religion, which carried you to all imaginable exceſſes of Cruelty, convinced all Mankind that there was a neceſſity of excluding you, rather than to leave you the name, and place the power in a Protector<hi>:</hi> For in good truth, they muſt have looked upon it as the greateſt folly, to have made ſuch a change in the Government, which would have been a means to deſtroy, and not to preſerve the Government. Sir, they ſaw your Temper, that was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95393:11"/>
bred up in ſuch principles of Politicks, as made you in love with A bitrary power, and bigotted to that Religion which always propagates it ſelf by Blood, could never bear with ſuch ſhackles as would even diſguſt a Prince of the meekeſt diſpoſition<hi>:</hi> This was your Temper, and how it is amended ſince you placed your ſelf at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> I ſuppoſe your followers can tell better than I.</p>
            <p>But what a regard and favour you have born to this Nation, was well ſeen from your firſt return to <hi>England,</hi> 1660. to your leaving it in 1688. You engaged it in two wicked Wars with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and a third with <hi>France.</hi> I would not have your Cattle love too much of your Grace and Favour: But truly if you had any for this Nation, you was pleaſed to conceal it, except in two things, in which you did <hi>England</hi> the moſt ſignal ſervice that ever man did, the one was deſtroying your Brother, and the other your running away; and if you will keep on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the ſmall River, that parts <hi>France</hi> from us, we will forgive you all the faults of your life. But notwithſtahding all the noiſe your party have made about you excluſion, I think they are now fully ſatisfied, or at leaſt may be, that thoſe three Parliaments that did proceed to exclude you, had juſt grounds for it; ſo that all your pretences ſtand convict, as fooliſh and impertinent: And theſe things being thus, can any man judge you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than an Enemy to Parliaments, and that way of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which made you and your Traytors ſo much to inviegh againſt your moſt juſt proceedings.</p>
            <p>1. You may remember, that the Nation could not be redeemed from that Bondage and Slavery that threatened it by the Arbitrary Government of <hi>Charles</hi> your Father, but by the Long Parliament that ſat down in the year 1640, and by the miſmanagement of affairs by thoſe, to whom the guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſhip of this Nation had been committed; they thought nothing would bring on a new Heaven and a new Earth, and repair the breaches in the Nation, occaſioned by the confuſion, rage, and diſtraction they laboured under; which were the conſequences of the aforeſaid miſmanagement of affairs, but by the reſtoring King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond; to gratifie this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Convention which met on the 25th of <hi>April</hi> 1660, hand over head, without any Preliminaries of aſſerting the right and priviledges of the people of <hi>England,</hi> ſo manifeſtly violated by your Grandfather, and Father, and ſo reſtored your Brother to his Throne, without the leaſt oppoſition: The hopes of the happy days under his Reign, quite blotted out the remembrance of the villanous deſigns that were carried on in the time of your Grandfather and Father, for the deſtruction of the Proteſtant intereſt; and furthermore, like Court-Paraſites, flattered him and you, ſtiling your Father the Martyr for <hi>England</hi>'s Church and Government: The King your Brother being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, he began to be as Arbitrary as either his Father or Grandfather had been before him, and the Kingdom lay under a neceſſity of ſubmitting to him, rather than run into a new confuſion and diſorder, or revile the old
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95393:12"/>
ones for the miſery they brought upon the Nation: The memory of theſe times were ſo odious to theſe Flatterers, that if the Parliament took notice of any of their Irregularities or miſmanagement of the Government, they were preſently charged with running back to the Parliament that ſat down in the year 1640; and they ſeeing the King reſtored without any terms, thought it was neceſſary to form a Council, conſiſting of a number of men, that were to meet at <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> in order to get ſomething in favour of poor Catholicks; and this was to be a ſtanding Council for that purpoſe: To this Council the Jeſuits both at home and abroad were to make their application from time to time, as occaſion ſhould require; and they having ſuch an encouragement as this, they could not but reaſonably expect ſome great thing from your Brother, becauſe of the Oaths and Proteſtations he had made to them of reſtoring their Religion, or at leaſt to give them all the Indulgence imaginable, till he had an opportunity of ſetting up that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of theirs as the publick Worſhip of the Nation; which they thought muſt of neceſſity come to paſs the one or the other, ſince he was not reſtrained by any Preliminaries at his admiſſion to the exerciſe of his Kingly power; this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal miſtake of the Parliament, was the cauſe of much joy to the Jeſuits, for upon this <hi>Courtney</hi> within a Fortnight after your Brothers coming in was diſpatched away to <hi>St. Omers,</hi> to give them an account of what a proſpect they now had of advancing the Catholick Cauſe, and what a Council was pitched upon to meet at <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> to manage the Cauſe of poor Catholicks, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their eaſe in reſpect of Religion, and what preferments ſeveral of the leading men of that perſwaſion were like to have at Court: So, Sir, this was the firſt encouragement your party received, through the want of ſome neceſſary reſtrictions, to have put upon your Brother, in order to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Nation from Popery and Arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>A ſecond encouragement the Popiſh party had to oblige men to undertake and engage themſelves in their villainous deſigns againſt the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Government of this Nation, was your Brothers neglecting the old Cavaliers, that (if they had any Religion) it was that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe men had been great ſufferers, not only upon your Father's account, but alſo upon your Brother's, to the ruine of themſelves and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; indeed they thought, and that very juſtly, that upon the Reſtoration they ſhould enjoy Halcyon days: But alas, through yours, and the advice of old Chancellor <hi>Clarendon,</hi> they were in a worſe ſtate than they were before; for theſe poor miſerable Wretches having Mortgaged their Eſtates to redeem their Sequeſtations, the remainder paid the Taxes to the King, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Mortgage; notwithſtanding all this, they are not at all counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the King, who, one would have thought, ſhould have made them his chief favourites, if he had retained one dram of gratitude. He had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, it's true, but none of the old Proteſtant Cavaliers; you will ſay then, who were his Favourites; you may remember that his Favourites were thoſe of the Popiſh party, in conjunction with a party of men who knew
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95393:12"/>
not his Father, but humoured him in his ſenſual pleaſures, and they were of the Female, as well as of the Male Sex, who were a ſort of Favourites his Father was not acquainted with; nor, in ſhort, do I find that he had ever any regard for his Fathers memory, in that he ſo baſely left thoſe, who had not only ventured, but loſt all in his Fathers ſervice; and theſe men having great Antipathy againſt the Papiſts, for carrying all before them in the Court at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in your Fathers time; were much brow-beaten by theſe Popiſh Favourites, and they being diſcouraged, were in no capacity to contend the point with that villainous party at Court, ſo that they in your Brother's time carried all before them in ſpite of fate: The poor Diſſenters, they durſt not ſtir, the Biſhops ſeverely chaſtizing them for their ſevere uſage of them in the times of the Civil War, and the high Church-party run in with this Popiſh party, as men that had deſerved well from the King, and whoſe Religion and theirs was of nearer a kin, than that of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; ſo that your Popiſh party having ſuch a Reinforcement from high Church-men, were conſiderably ſtrengthened, and taking the advantage of your Brother's neglect of the old Cavaliers, who hated them, they found by this means ſo much encouragement as to engage a number of men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake with them in their curſed deſigns.</p>
            <p>3. A third encouragement the Popiſh party had upon your Reſtoration, was, the great aſcendency your Mother had over the King your Brother, for ſhe being a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> inclined him to her ſide, ſo that he no ſooner left <hi>Bruſſels</hi> but he quitted <hi>Spain,</hi> and embraced the intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and an Alliance with that Crown, and ſhe living ten years after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, ſo fixed this as an habit in him, that all his life after he could never get rid of it, notwithſtanding all the provocations of the <hi>French</hi> King to the contrary, who upon the great inclination there was in your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you to him, became a mighty protection to the Popiſh party. By the way, Sir, give me leave to obſerve to you, that it was a moſt inhumane thing in your Brother and you to quit the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who entertained you both, when the <hi>French</hi> had in a moſt barbarous manner, and with all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach imaginable, expelled you both, and joyned with the then Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector againſt you to ruine you and your whole Family: again, obſerve how unjuſt it was, conſidering what proteſtations and promiſes both your Brother and you had made to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> of making and keeping a ſtrict al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, offenſive and defenſive, that you might be revenged of the <hi>French</hi> King, for his falſe dealing with you; yet, contrary to all your promiſes and proteſtations, it is remembred what ſucceſs the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador had with your Brother in his negotiations; for though he did not make any league with the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet he and the <hi>French</hi> King dealt with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> as if he had been an open enemy; nay, Sir, that he might not fall ſhort of his reſpects to his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> he moſt willingly waved a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Commerce, the ſaid Lord Protector had made, to the great advantage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and graciouſly left his people to be treated in their trade
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95393:13"/>
to <hi>France</hi> at the pleaſure of the <hi>French</hi> King: In a word, your Brother was no ſooner ſixt at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and you at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, but the <hi>French</hi> King was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your Confident, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſlighted; which, as it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt juſtice and humanity, ſo it was againſt the maxims of Policy and Prudence, the <hi>French</hi> Nation being natural Enemies of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the next Neighbour to it, and of all Nations the moſt formidable; all theſe conſiderations ſhould have made you to have made a firm alliance with <hi>Spain</hi> at that time, for their condition was very low, being brought to that ſad ſtate, in a great meaſure, upon the account of your Family, both in your Grand fathers and Fathers Reigns, inſomuch, that notwithſtanding the largeneſs of the Dominions of that King, yet out of them all, he could not find an Army to fight againſt the <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> this I muſt ſay, that God did viſit that Crown with ſevere Judgments, for their unjuſt dealings with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi> both in reſpect of the War they made with them, and the cruelties they exerciſed towards them.</p>
            <p>You will ſay the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was poor, yes ſo he was, and the Proverb was good, That Vermin will quit a falling houſe; you well knew that the Popiſh party could not bear up in their undertakings, in the deſign of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Religion into Popery, nor our Government into Slavery, upon the Credit, Purſe and Intereſt of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but upon the Purſe, Intereſt and Credit of the <hi>French</hi> King, your party thought they might with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs, and with more eaſe, accompliſh their wicked deſigns and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, againſt the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of theſe three Kingdoms. Let me tell you, Sir, that notwithſtanding all the efforts the Popiſh party made in the years 1660 and 1661, they all proved abortive; for they have not their expectation fully anſwered, for they wanted ſome conſiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to head them; but you know, your Brother and you thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be plaguy Godly for a little time, and therefore the Red-Letter-men were to expect a little longer.</p>
            <p>4. That all might not be loſt for want of looking after, your Mother comes from <hi>France</hi> to give thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſome countenance, and to be head of that Council that was appointed to ſit at <hi>Somerſet-houſe;</hi> you know the pretence of her coming over was a Treaty with her Son about the Marriage of Madam her Daughter with the Monſieur of <hi>France;</hi> but the real cauſe was, to make earneſt ſolicitations on the behalf of the Popiſh party, that they might in ſome meaſure receive the benefit of thoſe promiſes your Brother and you had made to them, and to moſt of the Popiſh Princes in Chriſtendom upon their account; and though you could not engage your ſelf to appear bare-faced, you at that time wearing a Proteſtant face, as did alſo your dear Brother the King, ſo that ſhe to encourage them came over and reſided here in <hi>England</hi> for ſome time; and that the intereſt might be ſtrengthened, the Marriage of her Son the King with the Daughter of <hi>Portugal</hi> was no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, than that of her Daughter with Monſieur: Give me leave to tell you, in this affair the Queen your Mother did teſtifie more love to her Daughter,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95393:13"/>
your Siſter, than ſhe did to the King your Brother, and more like a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> than a Queen Mother of <hi>England;</hi> by her coming over, ſhe did not only ſecure the intereſt of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but ſhe ſecured all the Popiſh party to be true to the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, and ſecured the <hi>French</hi> King to be their great friend, that would not ceaſe to do all good offices between them and his dear Brother the King of <hi>England,</hi> and they might be aſſured of you in a ſhort time; and alſo by her coming, a great number of Prieſts, Jeſuits, Monks and Fryers came over, who were careſſed with part of the Treaſure of the Nation, amongſt whom was one <hi>Kirton</hi> a Fryar, that had two hundred pound a year Penſion given him; the pretence was, that he was an excellent Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate-maker for your Brother the King: She alſo ſpurred on the Council that ſat at <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> to uſe that diligence that became them, that they might anſwer thoſe ends that their meeting together required: This plainly ſhews what encouragement the Popiſh party received by the coming of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Your Brothers Marriage with the Daughter of <hi>Portugal</hi> was another conſiderable encouragement, for though ſhe brought no conſiderable Fortune to the Crown, yet ſtill ſhe ſtrengthened the <hi>French</hi> intereſt; the <hi>French</hi> King in order thereunto propoſed and promoted the Match, for never was one word ſaid of it till the Arrival of the Queen Mother, and then you know that affair was driven on with all the Zeal imaginable, inſomuch that if any of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that were of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction had offered any thing againſt the Match with <hi>Portugal,</hi> he or ſhe, or they were in danger of being forbid the then Court at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe.</hi> Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> was one of the Council at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and he was in danger of loſing your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers favour and his place, at that board, only for expreſſing himſelf not with the due reſpects that ſhe expected, to the intended Match with <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi> and the Lord <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> was forbidden her preſence, for aſſerting that Match could never tend to the Honour and Advantage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: and the late Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> though he was a Papiſt, and Loyal enough, yet becauſe he was not of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and was againſt the Match, your Mother did but look ſowrely upon him; nay, you may remember, that for ſome time all the Honour he could get was but to be made the Son of a Duke, and it was ſome time before he could obtain that mark of Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The Match was concluded on, and over came that peice of <hi>Portugal</hi> Fleſh for His Majeſty's uſe, and ſhe was no ſooner arrived and fixed at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, but behold another Council was appointed there upon the account of the Catholicks, and ſo they had now two Councils, one at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and one at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and truly all things run on merrily on their ſide, they having two Queens to Eſpouſe their Cauſe; then finally you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo your Brother and you being both of a Religion, what greater incouragement could that villainous party of Men expect? and then came all the Ambaſſadors, Envoys, Agents; they had the Priviledge of open Chapels, ſo that <hi>London</hi> it ſelf was made a Nurſery for Popery.</p>

2. You now may ſee, what encouragements the Popiſh party had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the deſign of changing our Religion and Government, in order to bring in Popery and Arbitrary power, when you, being reconciled to the Church, and See of <hi>Rome,</hi> did eſtabliſh a third Council on the behalf of the Popiſh party, which became wholly yours, they owning you for their head; your buſineſs therefore was, to ſtrengthen their intereſt at Court, by having the King your Brother always ready to heap his favours upon them, and to enlarge their Intereſt in the Country, by obtaining ſuch Immunities for them, as no Proteſtant Diſſenter could ever obtain in all your Brother's Reign, notwithſtanding they were more quiet under their preſſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, than the other were under your Brother's favours and careſſes: your party before your arrival, at your laſt reconciliation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had met with theſe encouragements to engage men in this deſign: I pray, Sir, let us compare Notes a little, and let us ſee what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you gave thoſe, that were ingaged in the deſign of ſubverting our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Government; give me leave to put you in the mind of theſe, in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt encouragement that you gave them, you procured them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the Government; nay, if it were a place but of 20 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> a poor Catholic was preferred before another, if he ſtood in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him; you did eſpouſe that party, with that zeal, which put your friend <hi>Coleman</hi> into a ſort of a Religious extaſie, when he conſidered what a Prince God had given them, who was become to a miracle zealous, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author and Inſtrument of ſo glorious a work, of converting three Kingdoms, and by that perhaps, the utter ſubduing of a peſtilent Hereſy, which hath domineered over great part of the Northern part of the World a long time, and that there were never ſuch hopes as in this time, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the oppoſition you were like to meet withal; and truly, Sir, I could not blame <hi>Coleman,</hi> for this rapture of his; for the providing for your friends, was a good ſign of your converſion, to that degree of Zeal that Secretary of yours ſpake of: Now, Sir, the getting of your friends into employments, did ſtrengthen their hands, that they might be fit for buſineſs, or elſe Sir <hi>Patrick Trant</hi> might have continued in the Black-guard, for ought I know, to the day of his Death; but your converſion converted him, not only to your Church, but alſo converted him from being a Black-guard-boy, to wear a great name and place: I pray, Sir, to what end was Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> to have had a Patent for to be a Baron of <hi>England,</hi> but that the Popiſh party, might be more ſtrengthened in the North, that the little ones might be encouraged, and their numbers encreaſed, by the protection he might give them in your name; you were ſo ſucceſsful in this, that you boaſted to <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> and to others before him, that were your Confeſſors, that you did not queſtion, but that in a ſhort time, you could raiſe an Army of your Cotholick friends, to eſtabliſh the Catholick Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95393:14"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Why might not the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, ſhew himſelf greatful to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and procure them an Intereſt at Court? had not they an univerſal eſteem for their Loyalty to <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Second? Why in ſuch a heat, good Sir; where was the Loyalty of your Servant <hi>Manning?</hi> where was the Loyalty of thoſe that petitioned <hi>Cromwel</hi> for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience? and promiſing in lieu of ſo great a favour, to deſtroy your Family? alas, Sir, here is Loyalty for you; beſides all this, behold it was they that had a hand, nay, a great hand in your Fathers death; where was the Loyalty of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> murderers, that renounced your Fathers Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, after they had performed his Gracious Command, of murdering of one hundred and fifty thouſand Proteſtants. 'Tis true, they went into your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Intereſt, but not to ſerve him, but to be protected by him from the Juſtice the Parliament would have inflicted on them, for the wicked War they had in conjunction with that Villain <hi>Laude,</hi> fomented againſt the <hi>Scotch,</hi> and had alſo contributed to the ſame, and not only ſo, but had commenced that wicked War of the King your Father, againſt the Parliament of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> they were the Authors of our Civil War: But, Sir, ſuppoſe they had been great ſufferers upon your Father's account, was that an argument why they were ſo well provided for? alas, Sir, if that were an argument, why was it not an Argument for the old Cavaliers? no, they were too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to engage in any deſign againſt the good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, for they thought that when they engaged with <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, that they had fought for the Proteſtant Religion and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore many times wondered the Papiſts herded with them, and were much diſpleaſed to ſee Popiſh Councils and Councellors perferred before their Faces, and they ſcarce ſuffered to have the Kings Ear; therefore, Sir, you know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough theſe men were not ſit for your work, and ſervice; on the other hand, you were ſure of the faithfulneſs of your Popiſh crew, their Religion being ſecurity enough to you, that they would engage in the deſign with you, and therefore they were to be encouraged<hi>:</hi> Theſe Rogues had not one drop of Cavalier Blood in them, no, not one drop of any Blood, but that of the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> the poor Cavaliers were therefore to be ſtarved, and theſe fellows ſuffered to Revel and Surfeit upon their calamities; this was the firſt encouragement they received from you, <hi>viz.</hi> their Intereſt at Court.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your ſecond encouragement you gave them was, the check that you gave to thoſe who oppoſed them, eſpecially the old Cavaliers; for, Sir, you may remember that upon the coming in of the King, your Popiſh party made them themſelves very fine, nay, they reſolved that none ſhould be ſo fine as they, but the old Cavaliers were reſolved not to be out-done, but they would be as fine, though they did not live to pay the Taylors; but when they ſhowed themſelves at Court, your Brother and you ſcarce knew them, though the Papiſts at that time had all the demonſtrations of affection ſhew'd them, to the great aſtoniſhment of the poor Cavaliers; but when they had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95393:15"/>
recovered themſelves, they fell into a deſperate rage with the Papiſts, asking them what they did there, and began to arraign them for their former Rogueries, but you was pleaſed to tell one, that had ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in your Father's ſervice, that it was not for him nor any other to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, who had been your Brother's beſt friends; and therefore we might eaſily ſee, ſince that few or none durſt appear ſo againſt them, to ſuggeſt any thing that might bring them under the leaſt jealouſie, leſt they ſhould be ſaid to aſperſe the only friends of the Government; and I truly, have ſtood amazed, that the little Credit the Papiſts had got by ſhrouding themſelves under the protection of the King your Father, ſhould be ſo highly improved, nay, it was ſcarce credible, till the World ſaw the deſign in which with you they were engaged; then we plainly diſcovered the reaſon, why they that oppoſed them were ſeverely treated by your Brother and your ſelf, not for any ſervice they had done, but for ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture villany they were to perpretate, the reducing the Nation to the yoke of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> this was the reaſon why they were ſo dear to your Brother and you, and upon this account you thought they were men that were not to be oppoſed by any.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You gave them a third encouragement, which was, the peace they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in their Perſons and Eſtates in the Countries where they lived, ſo that they did not only eſcape thoſe legal arraignments upon the account of their Religion, but alſo upon the account of their many Traiterous deſigns againſt the Nation, and they lived in peace and quietneſs notwithſtanding their being obnoxious to many penal Statutes, ſo that ſince the return of your Brother, till their damnable deſign was diſcovered, who lived more comfortably in the enjoyment of themſelves and their Eſtates than they? and truly, none but the poor old Caalviers envied them, for when we ſaw the end for which they had this countenance, that it was, that in time they might the more eaſily engage with you in the deſtruction of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s perſon, and the Government of <hi>England,</hi> then all Proteſtants began to look about them, and no other expedient could be found, but the extirpation of thoſe that were in ſuch a damnable deſign as this, and led to it by villainous principles, ſuck'd in from their Prieſts and Jeſuites; the Parliament addreſs'd ſeveral times for the reſtraining the number of thoſe Vermin; but you know for the peace and quietneſs of the beſt friends of yours, few of them were put in execution; nay, Sir, when they were indicted for not coming to their Pariſh Church, once a month, a <hi>noli pros</hi> was obtained on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that they might not be diſturbed in the profeſſion of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth encouragement you gave them was, your ſtrengthening them with the favours and friendſhip of ſeveral Prelates of the Church, and your Brother's Miniſters of State, but as for the former, they were very careful to engage their Clergy not to preach againſt Popery, but againſt the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, for that the Papiſts and the Church of <hi>England</hi> did differ but in things,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95393:15"/>
nd points that were not material; hence it was, Sir, that your firſt Dutcheſs was ſeduced to the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the filthy treachery of Biſhop <hi>Morley,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Shelden,</hi> by the help and aid of the fantaſtical quibbles of old <hi>Gunning.</hi> There were three, that ſeeing the inſolency of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did make bold to give her a ſcratcht face, and wrote both learnedly and ſeverely againſt that filthy Whore, and therein did the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion very great and ſignal ſervice, for which reaſon none were by your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or you made Biſhops in the Church, but died unproffered, excepting one, who out-lived both you villainous Reigns, and is now a Prelate of the Church; I would fain know of that man, whether or no he was not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Brow-beaten by your Brother, or you; your Brother, twice in my hearing ſaid, he ſhould never be a Biſhop in his Reign; he made his words good, and if you had ſaid it, it would have been never the worſe: But thanks be to God, we have neither a <hi>Portſmouth</hi> nor a <hi>Cleveland</hi> to be Biſhop-makers in our Court: Our King hath made ſeveral, and none of them a Scandal to their profeſſion, you made not half ſo many, and what they were I will not here ſay any thing, but only this, that they are older now than they were ten years ago; one of them I ſuppoſe knows the price of a Bowl of Grains; but after all, by reſtraining the Clergy from preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Papiſts and Popery, gave them great incouragement to engage with your deſign levelled againſt the Religion, Laws and Liberties of theſe three Kingdoms, and the Death of the King your Brother<hi>:</hi> Deny this if you can, and let any of your Patriots ſtand forth, and anſwer what I now write, and convince me of any untruth if they can.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another incouragement you gave the Popiſh Party that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the ſaid deſign was, that you and they had Created in the King ſuch a truſt in you, that he committed the adminiſtration of affairs to your ſelf, and the leading men of your Popiſh party, and what they durſt not adviſe the King of at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that they would adviſe you at <hi>St. James</hi>'s, and there were very few of their projects that related to Popery, and the French intereſt, but were readily put in Execution, as the firſt and ſecond War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and many other things ſhall in their proper places be inſiſted on, and as for your power with the King, it is ſo plain, that all the Nation ſaw, that there was nothing done without your approbation and conſent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another incouragement you gave the Popiſh party was, that if any male content ſhould happen to diſcover your Wicked deſigns of Subverting the Government, and of killing the King your Brother, he would by no means believe them, and ſo that they would all of them come off with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, which made that villainous party grow very bold and daring, and to carry themſelves with that inſolency, that they were not to be ſuffered to live in a Proteſtant Kingdom, this, I ſay, will be further made appear in its proper place.</p>
            <p>2. I come now in the ſecond place to put you in mind, what ſteps you took to effect your deſign of changing the Government into downright
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95393:16"/>
Slavery, and the Religion of the Nation into downright Popery, and for the deſtruction of the Kings perſon; this is worth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of your conſideration, ſince God in his mercy to this Nation hath placed you in that admirable Climate at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> where you have time enough to conſider of theſe things, I pray, that if the little <hi>Welſh</hi> Gentleman, can underſtand any thing, that he may be taught theſe things, it may be he may have as much a regard to you, as if he were your own dear Child.</p>
            <p>3. The firſt ſtep you took for the effecting your curſed deſigns was, the debauching of the Nation, this I have touched upon in the firſt part of this memorial; you may remember that upon the 11th of <hi>May</hi> 1660, both Houſes ſent Commiſſioners to invite your Brother home, and Admiral <hi>Montague</hi> with the Royal Fleet to convoy him over, and in his Company came your ſelf and your younger Brother, and ſuch a Crew along with you, as if you intended to take up with <hi>Newgate</hi> for your head quarters, rather than <hi>St. James</hi>'s, or <hi>Whitehall:</hi> truly, Sir, this I may ſay, and call God to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I never heard an oath ſworn in all my Life, till the day of your bleſſed reſtoration; truly the day that you arrived in <hi>London</hi> was rather a day of madneſs than of prudent mirth and rejoicing, for your being delivered from your low eſtate, and entring into a ſtate of luxury and eaſe; you preſently began to change the face of the Nation, the Poor Cavalier party, under the perſecution of their adverſaries the Parliamenteers lived quietly upon that part of their Eſtates which was permitted them after their compoſition, and there was a face of Religion in the Nation, whereas upon your return all ſort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of men, even ſome profeſſors themſelves, did too much imitate the prodigality and luxury of the Court, which ſcarce entertained any but upon theſe terms then to Crown all to humour the King your Brother; the publick Theatres were ſtuffed with the moſt obſcene and filthy actions and interludes, one would have thought that <hi>Laude</hi> had been raiſed from the dead, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mazarine,</hi> to have written Books on the behalf of theſe proceedings, to prove that for the King's comfort they might be more obſcene: to juſtifie that, two Prieſts had the management of the Play-houſe, and to grace the buſineſs, had engaged their new Gracious Maſter to be preſent at the firſt opening thoſe Scenes of filthineſs; perſons brought to ſuch a degree of prophaneneſs and ungodlineſs came in little time to be of no Religion, whatever their profeſſion was before, and therefore indifferent to ſeem to be of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Intereſt and Temptation ſhould incline them, ſo no man will have much liſt or any conſiderable propenſity to be of that Religion, that ſhall condemn thoſe practices they are reſolved upon; now it is evident that there is no perſwaſion in the World, that ſo much countenanceth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery and prophaneneſs as the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo you had the ſucceſs you expected, in debauching the Nation; for how many turned Papiſts, to gratify their own and your luſts at once; but enough of this in the ſixteenth Article.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95393:16"/>
2. The ſecond ſtep you took, was a wicked Oath you impoſed upon the Nation; the Oath was in theſe words, I <hi>A. B.</hi> do declare and believe, that it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatſoever, to take Arms againſt the King, and that I do abhor, that Traiterous poſition of taking Arms by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt his perſon, or againſt thoſe who are Commiſſionated by him, ſo help me God. Truly, Sir, you are a pretty Gentleman; I pray let me have you pretty picture with this Oath coming out of your Mouth, and I do believe it would make a pretty ſhow, and if I ſhould be ſo happy as to ſee ſuch a ſight, I would ſay that this well contrived Teſt was of the firſt impreſſion, for I never met with any of our antient Laws, that ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged any to ſwear to an opinion, or belief: for I humbly conceive, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reaſon, that if ſwearing could determine all Controverſies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs, all learning, reaſonings, and inſtruction would be at an end; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore our Prick-eared Prieſts would ever aſcend a Pulpit, or our Biſhops in <hi>Charles</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s time, took ſo much pains in the alterations and additions of that uſeful Book, that takes up its quarters ſo near the Bible in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if ſwearing to beliefs and opinions, was of ſuch uſe in your Brother's Government, ſince he that ſwore the moſt, had the Maſterſhip of more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Religion, than his non-ſwearing Brethren, you deſigns could not well have gone on, till you had ſworn the members of Corporations, not to give your Crew any oppoſition, for they had been ſo often beaten by the Non-ſwearers of thoſe times, that they never love fighting; and becauſe they were a parcel of cowardly fellows, they were reſolved to forſwear fighting; and that they might not meet with ſuch rugged exerciſe from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they, inſtead of fighting, made them take up this more gentle trade of ſwearing, that they would not fight; and when you had tied up their hands from that ſort of practice, by this new Oath, you go to work to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us, believing that none would give you any oppoſition, ſince they had ſo luſtily promiſed to be quiet, by this pretty Oath they had taken, and in time, Sir, you had improved the point to ſuch a pitch, that a Member of Parliament could ſcarce enter upon any debate of any expedient, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Laws and Liberties of his Country, but his Noſe was wiped with this Oath, and looked upon as criminal, if he ſhould vote for an Act of Parliament to borrow the Militia of the King, it looking like entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an actual War againſt the King, you and your Traiterous party thought to have done wonders with this Oath, and truly they went a great way with it, but it never did a Tyrants buſineſs yet, nor never will.</p>
            <p>For do but remember that there was a Teſt that paſſed the Convocation in the ſhort Parliament, that met in <hi>April</hi> 1640, to preſerve the Hierarchy of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> your Companions you have with you, will tell you that it did not, for the very next Parliament, within the compaſs of a Year diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd the Biſhops ſitting in the Houſe of Lords, at which ſome of them gnaſhed their Gums, they having no Teeth to exerciſe that gift withal, for which they caged a goodly Troop of them in the Tower, with his Majeſty's
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95393:17"/>
Lyons, not for their Lamb-like carriage in the high Commiſſion Court, or their Dove-like behaviour in the Star Chamber; nay the poor Deans and Arch-deacons, they had a ſhare in their favour, for the Parliament eaſed them of all Temporal Juriſdiction, nay here was worſe than all this, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> entring into Covenant to extirpate that order of Men, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that was crowded out by the engagement, the engagement made its exit upon the Protector's aſſuming the Government; truly a Man that had but an <hi>Iriſh</hi> underſtanding, might have thought that Men had ſworn ſo long till they cared not what they ſwore, or to whom: Old <hi>Monk</hi> before he came out of <hi>Scotland</hi> cauſed all the <hi>Scots</hi> to renounce, and abjure your whole Family; and ſo he did the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigade at his coming to <hi>London,</hi> nay the abhorring and deteſting of your Family was a great part of the laſt Speech and Confeſſion of the dying Rump, and within a ſhort time in came your Family with ſeveral ſquadrons of Oaths, as if your Government had been to have been ſupported with thoſe Forces; truly you made them ſerve to adorn your Government, but this little Whipper Snapper of an Oath was to be its ſweet Anchor, but it did not do the buſineſs: for though you had taken that Oath to your Brother, it proved no antidote againſt his being poiſoned, nor you from being walked out of the Kingdom by your high Church Crew; but to give you your due, you and your Popiſh crew went as far with this Oath in your Conſpiracy againſt the Lives and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> as Men could do, for all men you judged were to obey and not to reſiſt, therefore you would give all diligence to ſecure the point to Pox us all with your <hi>French</hi> Power, and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; there were ſeveral other Teſts not worth the notice of any Man.</p>
            <p>3. A third Step you made to effect your deſign was the inflaming the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that were amongſt Proteſtants, you had as great a talent at this ſort of buſineſs as any man could be ſuppoſed to have, had your party kept pace with you to a hairs breadth, for at your coming how did you endeavour to heighten the difference between the Conforming and Nonconforming parties? how watchful were the Good men of the Epiſcopal party over the Diſſenters, judging them to be greater Enemies to their cauſe and Quarrel than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, becauſe of their great numbers? and being in a bodily fear that the Diſſenters would not only out-live, but out-preach them, this was a great crime, Sir, in the poor Proteſtant Diſſenters, which high Church would never forgive, for ſome of them cared as little for preaching, as you did for fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs it were with an honeſt Proteſtant at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> or the <hi>Kings-Bench Court,</hi> where you were always ſure to get the better of them, and then you very ſeldome gave quarter to any that lay at your mercy; nay did not <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs the Biſhops to revenge themſelves upon the Diſſenters for their ſevere uſage of them and their Clergy, for their ſcandalous lives and ignorance in the word of Righteouſneſs; nay, he did not only adviſe in the matter, but puſht on their taking revenge with Head and Horns together, rather than the poor Diſſenters ſhould go unpuniſhed, or that the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95393:17"/>
diviſion ſhould not be widened to the utmoſt; therefore upon the whole, let me ask you, or any of thoſe Traytors that were with you at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> whether theſe differences thus influenced, was not to betray us into the hands of your villainous Popiſh party, for it was not your Province, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſtrengthen the Proteſtant Intereſt againſt the Conſpiracies of the Papiſts; no, you will not pretend to that, for that would be a ſoliciſm with a vengeance; or did you judge that the Papiſts could by their plottings do any great damage to a Proteſtant Intereſt firmly united; truly it is plain, that becauſe of the ſtrength of a united Proteſtant Intereſt, you could have but a poor account of your well-laid deſigns; in a word, therefore it was the weakening the Proteſtant Intereſt you aimed at, and nothing could weaken them but dividing them, and then this point being gained, to work you and your Rogues went to deſtroy both, and had effected your deſign, had you not met with an unlucky fellow that diſcovered all.</p>
            <p>4. There was a fourth ſtep taken to effect your Popiſh and Trayterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and that was the engaging the high Church party, to run in with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh party, in arraigning the Diſſenters for Traytors and Rebels; nay, tho ſeveral of them, who had with much zeal fought under the late King your Father, and your Papiſts were ſomenters of the ſaid War, and would have fought againſt the King in the ſervice of the Parliament, if their ſervices might have been accepted of, and if any of them did fight for the King, it was becauſe his Cauſe was like to the Gallows, received all and refuſed none; it is well known, that it was the folly of ſome of thoſe you aſperſed that brought your Brother home, for which I think they have well paid for it: but what doth all this tend to? why they were to be battered at by the Church and Popiſh party together; but that they might the more effectually be deſtroyed, and then the Popiſh party with reaſon might expect the more eaſily to carry their point againſt high Church it ſelf, whom they judge He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks as much as they do the Diſſenters; and this I muſt ſay, that our high Church, if they had been deſtroyed by you and your party, they might have thanked themſelves for their ruine, though I muſt confeſs I ſhould have been ſorry that ſo great a number of men ſhould ſo heartily contribute to their own deſtruction, and reject our Brethren, that would ſo heartily have joyned in with them, to have deſtroyed you and your villainous party, in order to have preſerved the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>5. There was a fifth ſtep you made to effect your deſign, by creating in many unthinking people, eſpecially in many of our <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, that the Kingdom did enjoy a ſufficient ſecurity for our Laws, Liberties and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and therefore how your party uſed to quarrel with thoſe men, that were apprehenſive of our dangers, in thoſe caſes your Brother apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that our Religion and Laws, tho I ſhould have thought that his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the danger of the Proteſtants, had riſen from <hi>Nell</hi>

Miſtreſſes wanting ſome new rigging, if none had thought of the danger that we were in but himſelf; but we had four Parliaments that ſaw the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as well as himſelf, and did not only ſee the danger with which we were encompaſſed, but with what great difficulty we were like to meet withal in order to prevent it; till their eyes were opened, you went on with a full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer in your Plots and Conſpiracies, and met with great ſucceſs, ſuitable to that zeal, to which you were, as <hi>Coleman</hi> ſaith, converted in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; the plain truth is, that you had a mighty work in hand, and a mighty mind to it, and therefore it was fit you ſhould take mighty ſteps to effect the ſame.</p>
            <p>6. Another ſtep you took to effect your wicked deſign on foot, was to create and preſerve a Jealouſie in the King, of the faithfulneſs and loyalty of the People, and a jealouſie in the People of the ſincerity and good affection of the King to them; ſo that they ſeeing they could not keep up a War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the States General, yet they would maintain a War between the King and the People of <hi>England;</hi> and, truly they had their ends, for they brought your Brother, in a manner, to ſet up his Standard, and proclaim a War againſt his honeſt Subjects, by the frequent Rapes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the time of his Reign, upon the Laws and Liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; witneſs, his quitting his legal power, and ſetting up of a <hi>French</hi> mode of Government, and laying aſide thoſe Laws by which he was to have governed his people, ſo that he became univerſally hated by the honeſt party of the Nation, and thereby the more expoſed to the vengeance of your cut-throat Crew, who, to deſtroy him, would ordinarily expoſe his Government, that they might ſo diveſt him of friends in ſuch a meaſure, as that none might appear to avenge his death, but rather rejoyce in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as you and your party did when you had done his buſineſs; and I muſt ſay this of him, he died more lamented than you thought for, and leſs lamented than moſt Kings of <hi>England</hi> that died before him.</p>
            <p>3. I come now to ſhow you who aſſiſted in this Conſpiracy; you could not carry on any deſign without ſome great aſſiſtance, therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould be pointed out, that the World may know them from other men, and that the World may ſee my plainneſs and ſincerity in this particular, that your wicked party may be left without excuſe, that always admired you, and would not have had your Crimes detected: But, Sir, it was attempted, though in vain, by ſeveral Parliaments, to have called you to an account, whilſt you was <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but the King your Brother, at your procurement, broke up thoſe Parliaments that would have done the Nation and you too that right, that become the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots of their Country; but ſince it was ſo, I think it neceſſary to remind you of thoſe great aſſiſtants you had to ſupport you, in order to carry on your wicked deſigns, of changing our Religion into downright Popery, and the well eſtabliſht Government into downright Slavery; and of theſe in their order.</p>

1. <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King was your main ſupport in this affair, it was he that gave you his friendſhip, and the uſe of his Purſe to aſſiſt you, againſt thoſe who had reaſon to cry lowdly againſt you; though they could not be heard, theſe you called your Enemies becauſe they oppoſed Popery and the French intereſt, and theſe were looked upon not only Enemies to your ſelf, but alſo to the French King, nay the band of Penſioners thought they had gone as far with your as they durſt, and when they could not for their own ſakes keep your Company any farther, you preſently Proclaimed War againſt them, as being neither in the French King's intereſt nor yours, and therefore you ſtuck cloſe to him, and for what reaſon you can beſt tell; he did deſire you to make what propoſitions you ſhould think fit in the then conjuncture of affairs; your main agent there was Sir <hi>William Throgmorton;</hi> who was much obliged to you for the good opinion you had of him, for you acquainted Old <hi>Le Chaiſe</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Confeſſour, that the ſaid Sir <hi>William</hi> was a very honeſt Man, one of great veracity (though he was not a Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour) that held Correſpondence with <hi>Coleman,</hi> one of your Family in whom you had great confidence; and what then? truly you took the <hi>French</hi> King at his word, and made ſuch Propoſals to him as you thought neceſſary to bring your deſigns about; I pray Sir, what were thoſe Propoſals? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they were theſe Seven; 1. That it was neceſſary that your Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Friends ſhould be without the leaſt noiſe formed into Troops, for which there would be a Sum of Money neceſſary to put at leaſt two Months pay into their Pockets. 2. That his Majeſty would heartily come into the deſign, if 300000 <hi>l.</hi> were paid for Three Years, by which he might bridle the Impertinency of the then Parliament. 3. That in caſe the thing ſhould take wind, and that deſign ſhould reach any of their Credits, that all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions ſhould run in the Name of <hi>Johannes Paulus de Oliva,</hi> to render the thing very improbable, if any diſcovery ſhould be made. 4. That his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould ſet apart ſuch Sums of Money from time to time, as ſhould be neceſſary for the Landing of an Army in <hi>Ireland.</hi> 5. That his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould prevail with the King your Brother to lay aſide <hi>Arlington,</hi> and ſeveral other Miniſters of State, that were not in his Intereſt and yours, and diſſolve the Parliament. 6. That all Correſpondence that he the ſaid <hi>French</hi> King ſhould maintain with you, ſhould not come by the way of <hi>Barrillon;</hi> but by the way of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſador; and under a cover to <hi>Coleman,</hi> and that no Correſpondence ſhould be held with the King your Brother, but what you were to be acquainted with, but not he with yours, but when you pleaſed. 7. That what Money there was tranſmitted, was to be in the names of this <hi>Coleman,</hi> and Sir <hi>William</hi> your honeſt Man, and they accountable to you; every thing was agreed to, but that of the Three Hundred Thouſand Pound <hi>per Annum</hi> for Three Years to your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; 'tis true, ſince all Sums were tranſmitted, but the <hi>French</hi> King's Opinion and yours was the ſame with yours, that he could not mend his pace in the Deſign, and therefore not a penny could be got till he could give the <hi>French</hi>

King reaſonable good proof, of his Stability and Sincerity, as you had done: theſe Seven Propoſitions were the then Propoſitions, what other Propoſitions there were made when the deſign was ready for Execution, you ſhall have them in their proper place; but theſe Propoſitions were ſuch, as when the Popiſh Plot was diſcovered, would have proved fatal to you, and much to the diſcredit of your Brother the King, if <hi>Coleman</hi> had not been Hanged in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Peter Talbot</hi> Poiſoned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for both of them would have come in Witneſſes againſt you, and Honeſt <hi>Dick Talbot</hi> your truſty <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> would have been a Third, and being Covetous of gaining a Fourth, which was Old <hi>Plunket</hi> the Popiſh Primate, whoſe Death you haſtned, as a gracious reward of his telling them the deſign, he ſaved you from Suffering the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Juſtice of the Nation due for your then Treaſons, and you got him hanged for his pains; an admirable piece of gratitude.</p>
            <p>Some may inquire why the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was to be had aſide, I have told you already in the firſt part of my Memorial to you; but I muſt tell you now one thing more, that is, I will put you in mind of it, for you know it well enough, it ſo nearly concerned you; be pleaſed therefore to obſerve that the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was once the only Miniſter in Credit, and he thought himſelf out of all danger of the Parliament, for once you know that he had burnt his fingers with you in your Popiſh and <hi>French</hi> deſigns, and was in danger of being impeached, but came off you know how, and being ſo fairly delivered he faced about, and was always for the ſitting of the Parliaments, and to recover and increaſe his Reputation with the Parliament, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their greateſt Favourite, he exerts his power in appearing an Enemy to the Popiſh Party, tho' at that very time was a Papiſt in Maſquerade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not only ſo, but oppoſed the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt: to ſhow his Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Popiſh Crew, he revived certain Orders for prohibiting the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts from coming into your Brothers preſence, and put them in Execution at his firſt coming to be Lord Chamberlain; nay, he did what he could to ſtrengthen his hands againſt your mighty Ally the <hi>French</hi> King, and your ſelf; for he prevailed with the King your Brother, that he, and the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> (who had Married two of <hi>Min Heer Odyke</hi>'s Siſters) might go into <hi>Holland</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Odyke</hi> to make a viſit, as they did pretend, to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations there; but to your great Sorrow, you found that they went to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the then Lady <hi>Mary</hi> your Eldeſt Daughter, as a Match for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> a Match with whom you always abhorred, for you was in a very great rage, not only with <hi>Arlington</hi> and <hi>Oſſory</hi> for that preſumption of theirs, of offering at ſuch a thing without being made privy to the ſame, but alſo all <hi>Arlington</hi>'s friends at Court, lay under your great diſpleaſure; but ſome of them, who had as much Courage as you had Wrath, dealt plainly with you in the point, and told you, that your Daughter was not to be look'd upon as yours, but as the King's Daughter, and Child of the Kingdom, and ſo that your conſent was not much to be conſidered in the diſpoſal of her, but only the Intereſt of State; but this was not at all ſatisfactory to you,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95393:19"/>
and your <hi>French</hi> Penſioners, and Popiſh Crew, becauſe you all foreſaw by that, that the Proteſtant Intereſt would be ſtrengthened, and the <hi>French</hi> and Popiſh Intereſt hurt, and <hi>Arlington</hi> would render himſelf the darling of the Parliament, and the Proteſtant Intereſt, and the States General of the United Provinces.</p>
            <p>Well Sir, you may remember that this truſty friend of yours the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> ſet forth upon this Errand upon <hi>November</hi> the 11th, 1674, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not till the ſixth of <hi>January;</hi> during his abſence Old <hi>Veracity,</hi> and Duke <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and ſome other of your <hi>French</hi> Penſioners, who were the Perſons of conſiderable credit with the King your Brother, and did pretend to be united to you; Theſe Villains ſet up their Throats and roared, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming loudly, and with the greateſt violence againſt poor <hi>Arlington</hi> and his actions; and truly they gave you ſuch hopes in his abſence to blow him up and his whole party at Court, ſo that (as <hi>Beddingfield</hi> told me) you paſſed the time pretty comfortably, you expecting by theſe trayterous impliments to have routed him and all his Creatures, and in ſo doing they drew you on to believe, that upon the ruine of the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> they could do you Service and the <hi>French</hi> King, and that they could with the greateſt eaſe imaginable manage and deal with your Band of Penſioners; but proteſted to you, till they could get rid of him, they had not courage to ſpeak to the Parliament, for fear they ſhould not ſucceed; nay your old White-hair'd Friend, whoſe gratitude to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was ſo notorious, told you that if you could not get rid of <hi>Arlington,</hi> that the Parliament would ſit again in ſpight of them all; and further acquainted you, that if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould come to hear of this, that they had uſed their endeavours againſt their ſitting, would prove an unpardonable Crime, that neither the <hi>French</hi> King nor you, no, nor your Brother could ſave them from puniſhment; theſe Villains knew the greatneſs of their Crimes, and therefore they were forced to play an odd trick with you now and then to ſave themſelves harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but you, whoſe nature and property was never to forgive, was forced at this time to diſſemble with them, by your pretended acquieſcing in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho' full ſore againſt your proud Stomach, and if you remember, <hi>Arlington</hi> was too many for all your Party; for if I am not out, he would not have you to treat with the Parliament in his abſence; for on the Tenth of <hi>November,</hi> the very day before his departure, (he ſo managed his Affairs) the Parliament was put off till the thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> 1675.</p>
            <p>What overtures theſe two Lords made in relation to the match I cannot well tell, nor will it be much to the point if I could; but when they had done that for which they were ſent, they returned home; but, alas, the creatures found themſelves not able to prevail againſt <hi>Arlington,</hi> by thoſe means and arts they had then tryed, they reſolved now upon counſels which were to out-run him in his own courſe, which accordingly they undertook, and became as zealous men for the Proteſtant Religion, and Liberty and Property, as ever the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> could pretend to have been before; and in purſuance thereof, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

the King your Brother to iſſue out thoſe ſevere Orders and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt your Brethren in the Faith, which you knew came out in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1674/5, by which you ſee they, even they your own <hi>French</hi> Penſioners, did what in them lay to extirpate your own dear Religion, and to Baniſh your Brethren out of the Kingdom; what ungrateful wretches were theſe, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue ſuch counſels, as were in oppoſition to your Worſhip? Had you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced theſe Vermin? O yes, and they had profeſſed much duty and ſervice to you; what Scoundrels were theſe ſo baſely to leave you? Come, don't cry, your friend <hi>Coleman</hi> knew who it was that would ſupport you; in order to this, preſently an Expreſs was diſpatched over to <hi>France,</hi> and truſty <hi>Jack Smith</hi> was diſpatched away to the Moſt Chriſtian Turk, and oh what Complaints you made to his Father Confeſſor of theſe Rogueries; and truly it was high time to enter upon new thoughts, how to preſerve you in this juncture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, from the deceits of theſe men, upon whom you uſed to depend very much, for the ſupport of your Cauſe: alas, Sir, what would you have them do, they had for a long time been acting in your deſigns, till they were as obnoxious to the people as the Devil could make them; it was therefore highly neceſſary that they ſhould do ſome ſmall matter to render themſelves a little grateful to the Parliament, provided there was a neceſſity of its ſitting at the time appointed, and you know that nothing was ſo pleaſing to the Parliament as bruſhing of Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Jacket a little; notwithſtanding all this, the ſence of their Guilt was ſuch, that they had rather have ſeen the Devil than a Seſſion of Parliament, and therefore they would have been glad to have found out any expedient to have put it off, though they durſt not for their ears engage in it openly themſelves: But, Sir, what was all this but ſhamming the Nation? for all this while, like State-Moles, they were hard at work under-ground to ſecure you; for what they had done openly againſt your intereſt, and the intereſt of the <hi>French</hi> King, their point, Sir, was to whet your zeal for the diſſolution of the Parliament, and that they had been ſomewhat ſevere againſt the Saints of your curſed Church, only to make way for a diſſolution; and that an objection of the people might be fairly obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, <hi>viz.</hi> that the diſſolution of the Parliament was in favour of Popery; which clamour theyt old you was prevented before-hand by the ſeverity they had uſed againſt it.</p>
            <p>Upon this you ſent to the <hi>French</hi> King, as before, and made your propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in good earneſt, for it was but in vain to trifle, ſince you ſaw your ſelf ſhammed, you could but judge what ſort of Cattel you had to do withal, and what you had to truſt to if you lay at their mercy, and that you now muſt truſt in the mighty mind of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; then you made your application to him, and like a good Boy, you promiſe heartily to perform what was required from you; he complies with you, and ſo you were ſafe, you had his Purſe, and ſo you were eaſie, and <hi>Coleman,</hi> his 20000 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo all was well, and what could you deſire more; truly, Sir, it was not well enough yet, for not only <hi>Arlington</hi> put a great many tricks upon you,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95393:20"/>
and your French Penſioners had not been ſo cloſe to you as they might have been, if they would have put on Courage enough; theſe you thought you might have weathered, but alas, Sir, here was a Parliament; yea, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way that had done a thouſand Rogueries againſt you and your party: Truly Sir, I pity you much; what was to be done in this caſe? I have you much in my heart, for all your barbarous civilities you have ſhewed me, yet I cannot in the abundance of my grief for you forbear laughing to ſee what a ſad pickle you were in; but as angry as you were with <hi>Arlington,</hi> you could not avoid grinning at your tools to ſee what a diſtreſs you had brought them to, for if they left you, you were reſolved to deſtroy them, and if they engaged with you, the Parliament would do the like, therefore nothing could ſave you and your intereſt but the diſſolution of that haughty Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Come, chear up in the midſt of theſe troubles and afflictions, the old enemy of mankind ſtood by you, for the Cauſe was not ſo low but you found a revivate; you know that the French King did diſpatch Letters to your Brother, and preſſed him to a diſſolution of the Parliament, and promiſed him a good Penſion, provided he would never call another; was not here a friend at a pinch? well, what did you do in return of this favour? Truly you make him a French Grimace, and promiſe that you will improve this Royal favour of his; truly it was but fit you ſhould, for there was a neceſſity that you ſhould be rid of the Parliament, for your Penſioners had plaid you ſeveral Jades tricks, and had been very reſty for ſeveral Seſſions, ſo that you could neither make them lead nor drive; therefore, by the advice of your Council at <hi>St. James</hi>'s, the French King was heartily applied to, and preſſed with much earneſtneſs to write his thoughts freely to the King your Brother; which you know he did, and a ſumm of Money was ſent, as an earneſt of the French Kings affection to your Brother; and now you were in hopes all would do well, but <hi>April</hi> comes and the Parliament met, and no Parliament, diſſolved, but another prorogation; you upon this was very warm with your Brother upon the matter, and how could he anſwer this to the French King? At laſt your Brother dealt freely with you, as the French King had done with him, and told you that he could not tell which way to incline; the Arguments indeed you and your party had uſed, as alſo the French King, for the diſſolution, were exceeding ſtrong, and not well to be anſwered; and the Arguments for its continuance were as ſtrong; but, to your great grief, there was one ſtanding Argument that carried the King your Brother on to continue them, and that was this, if he did try them once more they might give him Money; if they did, then your Brother would have gained his point, and <hi>Portſmouth</hi> hers; if they did not, then your Brother told you he could diſſolve them upon their refuſal, and be as he was; ſo that he told them he was in a poſſibility of getting Money by their continuance: But did you not ſee the cheat of your Brothers Argument? and if you had had any Brains you would have turned the Argument upon him, and have told him plain, that a diſſolution would have certainly procured Money, and the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95393:21"/>
certainty of three hundred thouſand pound a year, was better than the bare poſſibility of getting Money by the continuance of the Parliament: Your Brother repented of his refuſing the French Kings offer, for in the year 1676 a gracious Compliance of Governing without Parliaments <hi>a la mode de France:</hi> But the French Kings Maw was not ſet that way at that time, but you, good man, according to your Propoſitions got what you aimed at, in order to have your party ready to riſe to do the work; and tho the French King could not diſſolve the Parliament, he went thorow-ſtitch with you to diſſolve both our Religion and Government; this was the firſt great ſupport you had.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You had the General of the Jeſuits, that was another great ſupport in your deſign, for you did not only make application to the <hi>French</hi> King, but alſo to him the ſaid General of the Jeſuits divers Letters were written, at which time the ſtate of the Jeſuits was ſuch, that they could not contribute much, they were content to part with what they were able; but there was a neceſſity of a great Sum to begin the War, to which end they were very confident that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, notwithſtanding the great and chargeable War, in which he was ingaged againſt the Confederates, would do what in him lay for the Reſtauration of the Catholick Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and that therefore his Reverence was applied to do his part; you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Coleman</hi> your Secretary not only in your name, but I ſuppoſe alſo by your Order, did make application to his Reverence about the ſame Affair; you did not wait long, but you had the Sum of Eight Hundred Thouſand Crowns, that was tranſmitted to <hi>Coleman</hi> your Secretary by Bills, under the name of Dr. <hi>Gibbs,</hi> a Phyſician that lived at <hi>Rome;</hi> and they was paid at four payments, the Bills were received by one <hi>Busby</hi> a Merchant then living in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome other of your faithful Crew in that City, and at that time you may remember that the ſaid General of the Jeſuits was with much difficulty perſwaded to take upon himſelf the Signing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, that were to be Iſſued for the Offices both Civil and Military, and Eccleſiaſtical too; ſo that no damage might accrue to you, in caſe any ſhould be ſo wicked as to diſcover the Deſign, and that this thing might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its ſelf improbable, and at the time of the advice of the Monies being returned, he was pleaſed to ſignifie the ſame to <hi>Barrillon,</hi> at which you were much offended that he had not done it to your Secretary; this particular paſſage may ſatisfie all mankind, that you were reſolved to quit the Cauſe with as much Honour as you could; but notwithſtanding when the Plot was diſcovered, the Word ſaw that it was not the General of the Jeſuits, that was ſo much the leader of this Conſpiracy, tho' heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, as your ſelf and the <hi>French</hi> King, and that his Signing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions was but a blind to ſcreen you from the publick Juſtice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<hi>:</hi> and alſo to defend your Villainous Ally from the vengeance of the whole Proteſtant Intereſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> in which quarrel thoſe Princes that were not of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church would have not have ſtood neuters in ſo Juſt a Cauſe.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95393:21"/>
3. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was another Support, for when the ſaid General of the Jeſuits had undertaken the point relating to Money, and had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſame, he aſſured the Fathers of the Society here in <hi>England,</hi> that the then Pope would not be wanting, when any conſiderable progreſs was made in that undertaking, you know what it was, and it ſhall be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you in its proper place: that you might not fail of the Popes aſſiſtance, you had Sir <hi>Henry Tichhorne,</hi> whom you conſtituted an Agent at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate your affairs with the Pope; and Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> was always ready to do his part, but was much concerned to ſee that you made ſuch uſe of <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> who was an impudent falſe fellow, and always ſpoiled the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in which he was engaged, and that the Pope did not much approve of <hi>Talbot</hi>'s being made privy to any thing of weight; but, alas, nothing could wean you from him, and therefore it was to no purpoſe to perſwade you: but come to the point; there was never yet any Conſpiracy carried on, but that <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prelate hath been at one end or another of the ſame; I pray obſerve, Sir, what diſturbances and fatal miſchiefs the claim and exerciſe of the Papal Authority and Juriſdiction hath occaſioned both to Princes and People, that were of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore you might have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hopes that the Pope would give you his aſſiſtance to convert three Kingdoms, that had ſo long groaned under the burthen of Hereſie and Schiſm; for certainly when you were pleaſed to communicate your zeal to accompliſh ſo mighty a work, he had the ſame mighty mind, which he expreſſed by his Tears, when he read your Letters, not for Grief but for the great Joy that the good old Gentleman had conceived, for the great progreſs you had made in the advancement of the Catholick Religion; and withal, engaged to write to the French King to perſevere in his good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of furthering ſo good a work, which Letters were carried by <hi>Tichborne,</hi> and were graciouſly and moſt humbly received by <hi>Lewis</hi> your friend, who was much encouraged, when he ſaw your Brother and you bleſt with ſuch an Ally. <hi>Barrillon</hi> acquainted your Brother with the Pope's zeal for his being delivered from the Parliament; it is well known that he cloſes in with every part of the deſign, but that of his own life, that your party did not communicate to him, leſt he ſhauld have begged their pardon, and not have conſented to be ſo far engaged. I dare ſay you could not blame him, it is neceſſary to put you in mind that <hi>Coleman</hi> made the ſame propoſitions to Cardinal <hi>Howard,</hi> as you had done to the French King, and he by your direction ſignified the great ſence you had of the friendſhip of <hi>Lewis</hi> your Ally, and of the great readineſs there was in you to make ſuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that his friendſhip, with all thoſe good Offices that you were capable of, all which was by him the ſaid Cardinal to be communicated to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> nay, he preſſed the ſaid Cardinal to uſe his Intereſt with the Pope, to preſs the French King to engage the King of <hi>England,</hi> if poſſible, to diſſolve that Parliament, that was ſo great a Bar to your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on your deſign, for the advancement of the Catholick Religion; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95393:22"/>
in order to this work the Pope was accordingly preſſed, and he wrote to the French King to preſs the King your Brother to diſſolve the Parliament; and further to encourage him with the offer of his Purſe, as he had done to you, but the Pope, when the Cardinal diſcourſed him concerning a new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, judged no Parliament of <hi>England</hi> would ever engage in the deſign of reſtoring the Cotholick Religion; therefore he thought that what was to be done muſt be without a Parliament, and that the French King ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what an advantage it would be to his greatneſs, to be liberal in a work of this importance; for whereas an old Parliament hath been hurtful to the Catholicks, a new Parliament can never be ſuppoſed to do them any good; therefore the good old Gentleman would by no means hear of a Parliament, and ſo his opinion and yours was much alike, but wondered at the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> concerning whom, he was pleaſed to ſay, in his Letter to the French King, that he was repreſented to him to be a good Catholick, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the heavy charge you brought againſt him, the ſaid <hi>Arlington,</hi> to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and withal, the Cardinal, by the expreſs command from his Holineſs, did aſſure you of his Holineſs, his Friendſhip, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al he ſent you his Benediction.</p>
            <p>And when your deſign was ripe, and almoſt ready to be put in execution, the Fathers were aſſured that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſupply you with a competent ſumm of Money, when he was ſatisfied that you had made ſome progreſs in the mighty work that you had upon your hands; and truly, Sir, it was an expreſſion of very great zeal in the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> if you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how he ſupplied the Emperour againſt the Male-contents in <hi>Hungary,</hi> tho the Apoſtolic Chamber was then much in debt; as it was a ſignal mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his zeal to ſtand by you with his Purſe, ſo it is a proof not to be denyed that he was a mighty aſſiſtant to you in this mighty work.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You had the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> for your aſſiſtance in this mighty work, for though Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the then Queen Regent of <hi>Spain,</hi> was at difference about ſome things in relation to the Government, and their own private intereſts, yet they both agreed to joyn with you in this work of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the Religion and Government of this Kingdom; and Circular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were by them both diſpatched throughout the dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> and with ſome difficulty they raiſed two hundred thouſand Dollars for the ſervice of that part of the deſign which was to be carried on in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was paid by ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Merchants reſiding at <hi>Galloway;</hi> at which <hi>Coleman</hi> was angry, and thought that you ought to have had the management of the Money, ſince that you were at the head of the deſign of reſtoring the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the three Kingdoms; but you reprehended <hi>Coleman,</hi> ſince the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants there had paid in the Money to the Popiſh Arbhbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who was ready at your command to tranſmit the Money, whenever you ſhould ſee i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> neceſſary; and beſides all this, your Brother had a great deſire at that time to borrow that very Money of you, which you could the more readily deny, whilſt it was out of your power.</p>

5. Another ſupport you had for the carrying the mighty work upon your hands was, the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Portlegrah,</hi> preſſed the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> to contribute to the carrying on of the great deſign then in hand, and had his Meſſengers ſent about to the Religious of that Kingdom; when you had raiſed for you the ſumm of fifty thouſand pounds, and a certain Lady was much concerned that no greater ſumm could be raiſed thence, ſince ſhe had prevailed with the Generals of the reſpective Religious Orders, to write to their Provincials and Guardians to contribute largely to ſo pious a work; but <hi>Perrot,</hi> a Secular, did pacifie the ſaid Lady, and did aſſure her that he had more reaſon to wonder that ſo much came, ſince the Jeſuits had wrote ſo many notorious lies not only to <hi>Portugal,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to many other places in <hi>Europe,</hi> of the ſtate and condition of the Catholic Religion in <hi>England:</hi> and, Sir, what he ſaid was true, he told you that he doubted the Jeſuits run too faſt, and it would do well that you obtained of the King your Brother Liberty of Conſcience for the Catholicks, it was as much as could be expected; but, Sir, you may remember that <hi>Beddingfield</hi> did endeavour to incenſe you againſt the Secular Clergy, who were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the ſaid <hi>Perrot,</hi> he being their Superiour here in <hi>England;</hi> and told you that <hi>Perrot</hi> and the Secular Clergy were a ſort of Raſcally fellows, that had neither Wit nor Courage to manage ſuch a deſign: but at length a ſmall ſpell being thrown in amongſt the Secular Clergy, they proſtituted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to your Cauſe; and <hi>Watkins,</hi> that was Superiour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> was written to by <hi>Perrot,</hi> and another attempt was made upon Prince <hi>Peter;</hi> but your deſign was diſcovered, and ſo all that attempt turned to no account to you at that time.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You had moſt of the Princes of Chriſtendom that were of the Popiſh Religion, and of the French Intereſt, to ſupport you in your deſign, by the means of the Popes Internuncio then at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> with whom <hi>Coleman</hi> your truſty Secretary held a great Correſpondence; and if you pleaſe you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Coleman</hi> in one of his to the Internuntio, that <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> the deſign proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered ſo well, that he doubted not but in a little time the buſineſs would be managed to the utter ruine of the Proteſtant party, which Letter bore date <hi>Aug.</hi> 21. 1674: but theſe Princes being engaged in Wars, they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, but if the deſign had proſpered, you know they had all engaged whenever there ſhould be a General Peace, to aſſiſt your Brother and you in that good work of advancing the Catholick Religion; but upon the diſcovery of the buſineſs, the whole face of affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> were changed; and whether you could get any Money from them I never learned ſo much, you know beſt, and ſo did your Traytor <hi>Coleman:</hi> But ſo much may ſerve for the point in hand, to wit, a ſhort account of thoſe who had engaged their aſſiſtance from abroad.</p>
            <p>4. I come now to put you in mind of thoſe who were engaged here at home, and as I ſaid before, ſo muſt I ſay again, that it was not the old
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95393:23"/>
Cavaliers that you had engaged in this villainous deſign, for they were better natured, and had a greater regard to our Religion and our Liberties, than to be drawn into this Conſpiracy, nor were they thoſe alone that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for then our danger had been the leſs, but there were ſome that ſeemed to be of the communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and were Papiſts in Maſquerade; but that I may be plain and particular with you, I will lay them forth to the world in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You had your Papiſts in Maſquerade, I bring them in foremoſt, and theſe were the wicked Miniſters, that notwithſtanding their mighty pretences to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed, to preſerve her, yet at that time they were penſioners to <hi>France,</hi> and abettors of the Popiſh party, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and thereby rendered themſelves Enemies of the Government, and of the whole Kingdom: Theſe were a ſet of Rogues that had not one drop of Cavalier Blood in them, but revelled and ſurfeited upon the ruins of thoſe men, who had done much on your Father's behalf, and had undergone great ſufferings upon his account, and your Brother's, and no care was taken but of their ſtarving for want of Bread; ſuch was your Grace and Favour to them. Your <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſters of State gave great proof of their heartily being engaged with you in the Conſpiracy, for they did what in them lay, to ruin the Proteſtant Intereſt in that Kingdom; they over-turned the Laws and Liberties of that antient Kingdom, and ſo reduced the Laws to the Will of the King your Brother; that none could tell the difference between the condition of that People and the Subjects of the <hi>French</hi> King, excepting him; that the <hi>Scotch</hi> were by them made the greater Slaves, and it was a rule that your Conſpirators at St. <hi>James</hi>'s laid down, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> Slavery and Debauchery was the ſureſt way to bring in Popery, as Popery and Debauchery would certainly bring in Slavery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, both which was to be effected, or all would be loſt: Your wicked Miniſters at Court in <hi>England,</hi> good men, they plied their buſineſs with as much zeal as poſſibly they could, to make all things ready againſt you mounted the Throne, and truly, they met with little or no oppoſition in their progreſs, for the then Parliament, through their being corrupted and bribed by the Miniſters then employed, they had loſt much of their authority and eſteem, ſo that though they ſometimes made a little noiſe about Popery and Arbitrary power, they durſt not be over bold, becauſe that then they would have endangered their being diſſolved, which was worſe to them than death it ſelf; ſo that by theſe means your wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy went on with impunity, and few or none were called to an account, till the diſcovery of the Plot. It is true, they now and then roared againſt <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> they got <hi>Buckingham</hi> removed from being a Councellor; they, it may be, might have an aching Tooth at ſeveral, but I know nothing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95393:23"/>
they did againſt any of them, but make a noiſe till your true friend appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then they did talk with ſome of your Conſpirators, and would gladly, Sir, have ſpoken with you, but that you went to take a little Air in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You had the Popiſh party that were engaged with you in a bare-faced manner, and with as much impudence, as your Heart and Soul could deſire, Prieſts, Noblemen, Gentlemen, throughout the whole Kingdom, ſo that you were in a very hopeful way of doing your buſineſs, had not God in his mercy prevented it; they were all ready, they wanted but the word, and the buſineſs had been done to all intents and purpoſes, and I doubt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſſibility of retrieving.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You had your Army ready at hand, and if they might have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to be a ſtanding Army, they would have done what you command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you had your <hi>Iriſh</hi> villains in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that wanted nothing but your word, and they were ready to have engaged in any thing that ſhould have contributed to the advancement of the Religion, to which you were ſo miraculouſly Converted, that your zeal was ſuch, that you valued it above all things in the World, and therefore your deſign could not but thrive, ſince you had the benefit of ſuch admirable aſſiſtance, ſo that reaſonably you could expect nothing leſs, than the extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the total overthrow of <hi>England</hi>'s Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You had a certain Queen, that had received very great affronts from you know who, her Bed invaded, and defiled by a parcel of Whores, and it was high time for her to declare her reſentments, by engaging her ſelf in the Conſpiracy, eſpecially ſince Mother Church was to be advanced, and Hereſie, which had ſo long domineered in theſe Northern Countries, to be extirpated; ſhe knew what aſſiſtance you had from aboard, and therefore, Good Lady, ſhe would not be behind hand at home, eſpecially ſince ſhe could no otherways be revenged for all the wrong that had been done her. She was brought upon the Stage for it, but he that was moſt concerned, thought he could do no leſs in point of Honour, to preſerve her, though it was from the publick Juſtice of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You had your Female Companion, which was pinn'd upon the Nation, by the Advice and Counſel of <hi>Lewis</hi> your Ally, who, in order to ſecure your Brother and you to his Cauſe and Intereſt, adopted her a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and was to pay her Portion; ſhe was a main inſtrument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Popery and Slavery, and what intercourſe there was between you and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Marriage with that hopeful piece of Houſhold-ſtuff, I have already ſhewed you in my firſt memorial: the band
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95393:24"/>
of Penſioners had ſuch a foreſight of the ſad conſequences of that Marriage, that they made many Votes, and did Addreſs the King your Brother, to prevent the conſummation thereof, as appears in the Journals of the ſaid Parliament; and her carriage when ſhe was Dutcheſs of <hi>York,</hi> and when ſhe wore the Name, Stile, and Title of Queen, was a ſufficient proof of her intentions to advance the deſign of ſubverting our Religion, and changing the Government, and murthering the King, the Jeſuits your truſty friends can well tell to this day.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You had the ſtanding Court-Whores that were engaged with you; for this, let me tell you, that whoring and conſuming the Treaſure of the Nation, were Crimes that were to be pardoned, but their being State-Whores was the thing that rendered them in their day to be a greater grievance to the Nation, for they were put upon your Brother to betray his Councils to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and it was by their aid and aſſiſtance that you compleated that mighty part of converting theſe Kingdoms by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning him; for though he was a Papiſt, yet not Papiſt enough to hold the Throne, and what ſteps you took in his time you took by their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſometimes you met with unexpected delays, ſo that you could not preſerve alive the work that was upon your hands, and therefore it was reſolved that he muſt dye, that the work of the time might go on without contradiction or delay, your Jeſuits reſolved upon it in the years 1676, 1677, and 1678, the Whores agreed to it in 1677/8, upon the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with your Daughter.</p>
            <p n="7">7. You had your Brother engaged with you in the whole deſign, but that of his own life, and I ſuppoſe you could not expect his conſent to that part of the Conſpiracy, and therefore to prevent his Jealouſie of that, you forged a plot upon the Diſſenting party, and began with the Lord <hi>Claypoole,</hi> who was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and you had two of your Popiſh Cut-throats ready cut and dried, to have ſworn him out of his life, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, ſo that you might deſtroy the King and, lay his Death at the door of the Diſſenting Proteſtants; and in this, Sir, you happily failed, when I appeared, to take your Cauſe and Deſign, and laid it before the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, who were willing to ſave your Brother's Reputation, if it had laid in their power, and his Life, if he himſelf had been pleaſed graciouſly to conſent to it, but he would not, and therefore, through the bleſſing of God, you did his buſineſs as effectually, as if Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> had done it himſelf. This I put down to ſhew you, that ſince he would not let the Parliament preſerve his life, the deſtroying of which was one of the two good things that ever you did, the other was your running away.</p>
            <p n="8">

8. You had our high Church brokers, that through their folly and madneſs againſt poor Diſſenters, turn'd Pimps for, nay, proſtituted themſelves and their Cauſe to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> rather than the Honeſt Party of <hi>England</hi> ſhould eſcape the gracious Vengeance you deſignd for them. Did they not, to ſerve your Cauſe and Intereſt, preach Sedition, and villi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie the Reformation, promote Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, aſſert Popiſh Principles, decry the Popiſh Plot, and turn'd the ſame upon the Proteſtants, and endeavour'd to ſubvert the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Rights and Privileges of Parliaments? In a word, many of theſe Devils brokers, they appear'd to all ſober thinking men, a very ſcandal and reproach to their Function. And, that I may clear this point, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſome of them, by Name, that the World may ſee theſe ſort of Rogues, how they help'd on <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> to which they were by your Brother and you engaged; and for the doing of which, they had your Brother's Countenance and yours.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt I ſhall bring upon the Stage was old <hi>Sheldon,</hi> a whoring wicked Fellow, and in his younger days was as lewd as his Gown could make him: It is well known, that there was none greater than he and your Servant <hi>Coleman,</hi> none more ready to ſatisfie your former Dutcheſs, that ſhe might turn Papiſt, without any danger to her Soul: This, Sir, was at your inſtance. And to him,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We joyn <hi>Morley,</hi> that wicked Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> that urged the Dutcheſs with the neceſſity of obeying her Husband, and that there was but little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the two Religions, and he hoped to live to ſee an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Your old Friend <hi>Gunning;</hi> he was a Fellow of rare Principles, and of him I ſhall ſay nothing, he having ſhewed himſelf in his own colours in the Houſe of Lords in his time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let me add old <hi>Coſins,</hi> that met with his Friend, a Papiſt, after the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> upon the Return of your Brother and you, to the ruine of the Nation, and ſwore, <hi>God damn me, Old Boy, we have ſav'd</hi> Bell <hi>and the</hi> Dragon, <hi>and we will not be long before we make your Church and ours to meet, that we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of theſe Fanatick Rogues.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. I will inſtance in <hi>Guy Carlton,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> that ſaid at the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Table, in the hearing of Biſhop <hi>Gulſton</hi> and <hi>Gunning,</hi> 
               <q>He had rather have Poperty than Presbytery in <hi>England,</hi> for the Difference between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might be compoſed, but it was impoſſible that ever the Presbyterians and the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ever be reconciled.</q> At which words Biſhop <hi>Gulſton</hi> took offence and departed. There were others of the ſame Kidney, but your inferiour Clergy were without number; there was your <hi>Thompſon</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and your raſcally Chaplains, and others, Rogues of a deep dye: Theſe, I ſay, Sir, were your reverend Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the mighty Work upon your hands, though they did not foreſee the evil Conſequences of this their Carriage in reference to the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> both as to its Religion and Government: Nay, I hope they did not fully ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Deſigns; if they did, you, I hope, will judge of them according to their Merits.</p>

5. You being ſo well guarded and regarded, you were in a little time reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſet up and ſhew your ſelf and wicked Party what you would be at; but, Sir, I took pity upon you, and would not let you diſcover your ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I laid it open, and the Deſign of your Pope, French King, General of the Jeſuites, and the Society, and your Brother and your ſelf, which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Sword, to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion and the French way of Government. To effect this glorious Deſign, you and your Brother gave the then Pope Authority to entitle himſelf to the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have the abſolute Power and Government of the Church. In order to this, he diſpatched his Legate into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> was to have come for <hi>England,</hi> and your Brother's truſty and well-beloved Cuckold and Councellor was to have had a Cardinals Hat, and was to have gone for <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have taken Poſſeſſion of the Eccleſiaſtical State of that Kingdom; in the behalf of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> the two others were to do the like in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Moreover, ſir, by your Brother and you it was contrived and agreed on, that the General of the Jeſuites ſhould derive a pretended Power from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (with which Project the French King was highly pleaſed:) According to this Project, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did grant a Commiſſion to the ſaid General of the Jeſuites, and this Authority the ſaid General did derive to <hi>Thomas White</hi> the Provincial, to iſſue forth the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of him the ſaid General of the Jeſuites; and accordingly be, with the Counſel of the Jeſuites in <hi>London,</hi> did iſſue forth ſuch Commiſſions, to Captain-Generals, Lieutenant-Generals, and Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, Captains, and the Advocate-General <hi>Richard Langhorn,</hi> and to your Secretary of State <hi>Coleman;</hi> you have a whole Liſt of them in my Narrative already printed and publiſhed for your ſpecial ſervice, altho' not by your Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Further to carry on your wicked Deſigns, your Jeſuites, by the ſame Authority conſulted concerning your Brother; and becauſe he was not a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loper in your Cauſe, he was by them condemned to death, and that was to be executed either by ſtabbing, ſhooting, or poyſoning him: To this your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Coleman</hi> was privy; and ſay, you know nothing of the matter, if you dare, to this part of the Conſpiracy; The Court of Claims in <hi>Ireland,</hi> if they had then been ſitting, would have declared him Innocent, upon your Letter, as they did the Marquis of <hi>Antrim,</hi> upon your Brother's; nay, Sir, if they had carried their Point, then you were to have received the Crowns, as forfeited by your Brother to the Pope, as of his Gift; and you was to have been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have ſuch Prelates and Dignitaries in the Church, and ſuch Officers in Commands and Places civil, naval, and military, as he had and ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionate; and you had agreed both with him and the French King to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Proteſtant Religion, and to conſent to the Aſſaſſination of the King your Brother, and to maſſacre, by the help and aſſiſtance of the French King, the Proteſtants, to Fire our Towns that ſtood in oppoſition to theſe cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of yours. You agreed to pardon the Aſſaſſines, Murderers, and Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and in caſe you died without Iſſue male, theſe three Kingdoms were to be

made three Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> and become Subjects of that Crown for ever. Here your Brother and you were engaged to the French King: And that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> might not pretend to the ſame, he was alſo condemned, and deſigned againſt by Name, by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> and Conſent of the Pope, French King, your Brother, and your ſelf; and how you appear'd in the Deſign againſt him I have already ſet forth in my firſt Memorial to you: Truly you your ſelf muſt not have eſcaped, if you had not heartily comply'd to follow ſuch Steps and Counſels as ſhould have been at any time propoſed by your Counſellors at St. <hi>James</hi>'s. You have here laid before you the deſign in ſhort, and it was a black one (God knows); and, What ſay you to it now? Sir, if you will let the little Gentleman of <hi>Wales</hi> learn to read, (I have a good Schoolmaſter for him) he may ſee here the true Picture of your ſweet ſelf, which he may ſpell over by degrees; for I would not have the Boy have too much load at a time laid upon him, leſt he ſhould be diſabled from ſerving the Tyler, his true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a Hod of Mortar or ſo, in order to its conformable Livelihood.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Concerning the diſcovery of this Plot of yours, 'tis fit a word ſhould be ſpoken to that point, becauſe I believe the revival of this Story will much oblige you and your ragged Crew at St. <hi>Germain</hi>'s, and your Saints you have left behind you. You may remember, that your deſign proſper'd ſo well, and your damnable Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y were ſo inſolent, that notwithſtanding the fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces your Brother and you uſed for the keeping them up, and your old Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament briber put your Brother upon the asking of more Mony, and no War with <hi>France;</hi> notwithſtanding they had ſo largely paid for the War they had adviſed to be begun with that mighty Monarch, and they conſider'd that an Army without a War would be of dangerous and pernicious conſequence to the Nation, therefore they agreed to this Vote, in anſwer to your Brother's Speech made to them ſome time before; <hi>Reſolved, That the Houſe taking into conſideration the ſtate of His Majeſty's Affairs, and the great charge and burthen His Majeſty and the Nation lies under, by the Army now in being; we humbly are of opinion, that if His Majeſty pleaſes to enter into a War with the French King, the Houſe is, and always will be, ready to ſupport and aſſiſt in that War; but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then they will proceed to the conſideration of providing for the ſpeedy disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Army.</hi> And truly, dear Sir, you could not well blame the Parliament for this Vote, for your deſign in general did to them appear, notwithſtanding the plauſible Arguments your Villains uſed for the keeping up of that Popiſh Army, tho' you know this disbanding the Army was not the thing you aimed at, for you never deſigned it from the firſt moment that it was raiſed, for it being Officer'd to your Hearts content, was that which the Catholick Cauſe, with the aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> (when it was at leiſure by a general Peace) was built upon. Now this Vote coming inſtead of Money, upon theſe hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, no way ſuited with the mighty deſign you and your Conſpirators had in hand; for tho' you had, as I ſaid before, got a pretty Spell from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, yet that being imploy'd by your old Friend the Parliament-manager, and the reſt of your Rogues, as I have mentioned before, Mony was wanting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95393:26"/>
to pay your Soldiers and Fleet; and truly <hi>Nel Waal</hi> and her Miſtris, and the reſt of the Bawds, Pimps, and Whores, had ſwept a great deal of what was given by theſe methods from the Parliament, for holy ſecret ſervice.</p>
            <p>This Vote therefore made you and your Conſpirators very uneaſie, your appointed time of ſetting up being come, and prudently (as Men in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) you obtain'd of the King your Brother to give the angry Vote of the Houſe a mild Anſwer. The Vote before mention'd paſſed the Houſe, and was ſent to the King your Brother on the 27th of <hi>May,</hi> upon a <hi>Monday;</hi> the next day, the 28th, His Majeſty ſent them this Meſſage; <hi>His Majeſty having peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Vote of this Houſe, hath thought fit to return this Anſwer, That the moſt Chriſtian King hath made ſuch Offers for a Ceſſation till the 27th of</hi> July, <hi>as His Majeſty does not only believe will be accepted, but doth alſo verily believe will end in a general Peace; yet ſince that is not certain, His Majeſty doth by no means think it prudent to diſmiſs either Fleet or Army before that time; nor doth he think it can add much to the Charge, becauſe the raiſing the mony, and the paying them off, would take as long time as that, although the ſpeedieſt disbanding that is poſſible were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; That in the mean time His Majeſty deſires ſome Supplies may be provided for their ſubſiſtence; That as hitherto they have been the moſt orderly Army that ever was together, they may be encourag'd to continue ſo; That there is another thing which preſſes His Majeſty with very great inconvenience in his domeſtick Affairs, which is the want of the</hi> 200000 <hi>l. you promiſed to repay him at your next meeting after, which doth affect the whole Branch of his Revenue, by having a fifth part taken out of every Payment, which ſhould be applied to the neceſſary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes of his Houſhold: He doth therefore deſire you would immediately apply your ſelves to the Repayment of that mony to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe having received this Meſſage, they took it for granted, as well they might, that their Work was done, and began to look about and conſider what was firſt to be done; they ſaw well enough to what intent the Army was raiſed, and began to ſuſpect they ſhould never be able to lay the Devil you intended to raiſe by that Army of yours, for they had ſeveral Items of your Conſpirators correſponding with <hi>France,</hi> from whence they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Brother and you was to have Mony; and by the management of things at home, they found it would be very difficult to unhinge your deſigns; they reſolved to raiſe Mony to disband the Forces with all ſpeed, and to continue none in pay any longer than Mony could be raiſed; ſo they vote a Land-Tax of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> to disband the Army, which was to be done by the latter end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> at the fartheſt, and began to think upon another Bill, to ſecure the Nation from <hi>Popery,</hi> and to take care of us when we were dead, by paſſing a Bill to award the Act for burying in Woollen; but your Brother ſeeing the Houſe of Commons very buſie about the disbanding the Army, ſent them a Meſſage on the 7th of <hi>June,</hi> as follows; <q>His Majeſty, in his Speech to both Houſes on the 23d of <hi>May</hi> laſt, told them, That if he were made able, he would keep up his Army at Land, and his Fleet at Sea, for ſome time, till a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, if that might be; but becauſe that would depend upon your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, he left it to you to conſider, whether to provide for their ſubſiſtence,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95393:26"/>
or to disband them ſooner: His Majeſty hath often ſince had his Thoughts imploy'd upon the ſame ſubject, and is every day more and more confirmed in his firſt Opinion, to wit, that the ſaving a few days Expence can no ways countervail the Prejudice that would proceed from the parting with his Fleet and Army, if after that a Peace ſhould not follow; and tho' it ſhould, yet the hazarding ſo much upon the meer preſumption of the iſſue of the thing it ſelf, altogether uncertain, and quite out of his own power, is hardly to be countenanc'd by any Precedent; His Majeſty therefore again recommendeth to the conſideration of this Houſe, his Advice on the 23d of <hi>May</hi> laſt, that they would ſee the Effects of the Ceſſation in <hi>Flanders,</hi> before His Majeſty be neceſſitated to diſarm himſelf, but more eſpecially of that part of the Army which is in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which if he ſhould recall before the Peace, would be liable to a very bad conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> that having taken ſeveral of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Towns into his protection, he had without any reaſonable Warning, in order to their regarriſoning, withdrawn his Forces, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thoſe Towns to the diſcretion of the Enemy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I pray remember, that notwithſtanding this Meſſage, the Houſe of Commons did not think ſit to keep up your <hi>Popiſh</hi> Army, for that they now plainly diſcover'd the uſe and purpoſes of this Army, and they knew who adviſed the Speech, and thoſe two Meſſages, and had a pretty gueſs at the meaning; and therefore, tho' ſome of the Houſe were for giving longer time, yet the generality were of opinion, they had been kept too long already, and ſaw it abſolutely neceſſary, notwithſtanding the fair ſtories, That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was never to part with them now they were raiſed, but that you and your Conſpirators had another Work to do for them. And as ſecret as the thing was carried, they had an account both of the Letters of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and of all your Negotiations with the French King and his Miniſters, as well as your Villanous Jeſuites had from time to time an account of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Houſe of Commons. In ſhort, after many Debates, the Houſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of a Bill to raiſe Mony for the disbanding of the Army, and gave them for doing it till <hi>July</hi> for that part at home, and thoſe in <hi>Flanders</hi> till <hi>Auguſt</hi> following; and after paſſing the additional Bill for burying in Woollen, they provided the Reimburſement of the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> formerly borrowed, and which had been ſo often preſſed to be paid: They aroſe, being adjourned till <hi>October</hi> following; but fain would your Conſpirators have had longer time, by the Parliaments conſent, for disbanding their Army; but ſince you could not have their Conſent, you and your Villains were reſolved to do it without Conſent. The next project you had, was to attempt the ſettling a new Exciſe upon the Crown, for the better ſupport of the Government, upon pretence that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was not ſufficient; but the Houſe of Commons did not reliſh it, the very <hi>Band of Penſioners</hi> oppoſing it; and the reaſon for it was, that in caſe there ſhould be more ſtanding Revenue, their <hi>Trade</hi> would be ſpoiled; for then there would be no need of their ſervice, and your old Parliament-briber would keep his Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and his Monies too, without which thoſe Raſcals could not live: but the Parliament being gone, you and your Rogues being a little unſatisfied that you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95393:27"/>
had not bubbled them out of more Mony, began to mutter behind their backs of their unhandſom carriage to the King your Brother, and to load the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with the Infamy of being the cauſe of the Ceſſation like to be, and the Peace which was expected to enſue; the French all this while playing their Rogues tricks in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſtreightly blocking up <hi>Mons,</hi> which they expected to carry before the Peace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces that were in <hi>Flanders,</hi> under the command of the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> were reſolved to ſuccour <hi>Mons</hi> before the Peace took place; but the French King being aware of their deſigns, preſſed night and day, the more to ſtreighten the Town, and ſtopped up the ways, ſo that all relief was hinder'd from coming to them; for <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who did all this, had a vaſt Army with him; the very Flower of <hi>France;</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> at the earneſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> were reſolved to ſuccour the Town, that it might not fall into the hands of the French before the Peace was concluded; they march directly for <hi>Mons,</hi> where they found it cloſe block'd up by the French Army under the command of <hi>Luxemburg;</hi> but notwithſtanding, the getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mons,</hi> by reaſon of the Blockade, and the advantageous Poſts the French were poſſeſſed of, as if there had been a new Courage put into the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and as if it were a fatality on the French, to blemiſh all his former Enterprizes, and to give him a parting blow, the Prince with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then with him preſſed upon the French ſo hard, that they forced them out of their advantageous poſts, and made them quit the Field; and by this courſe <hi>Mons</hi> was ſuccoured, tho' with the loſs of many Men on both ſides; but the French were ſtrangely beaten, and retired in great diſorder in the Night, which was ſo great a blemiſh to the French King's Glory, and ſtruck ſuch a Fear upon his Army, that it was verily thought by judicious perſons, that had the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> followed the blow upon the French, they had ruined his whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>Your Deſigns on foot beginning to appear to moſt thinking men, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this ſad diſaſter, I remember your Countenance was diſorder'd in a ſtrange manner, as if you had broke up ſome Houſe or robbed ſome Church, for which you were to be called to an account; and then ſometimes you would mimp up your Mouth like ſome old Cuſtard-maker, and ſay, It was a hare-brain'd raſh Act done by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Duke of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it was upon the ſelf-ſame day that your Brother was made acquainted with that part of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Conſpiracy that concerned his Life; but of that in its proper place.</p>
            <p>But upon this defeat of the French, at which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n honeſt company of your good Friends laughed heartily, and as heartily drank yours and your Conſpirators Healths. But I pray Sir, how did your French Muſtard-maker take all this? truly, Sir, you well remember he ſent ſeveral Meſſages to your Brother and you, and told you both very roundly, that our Forces were the cauſe of this Affront and Abuſe put upon them; and, in plain terms, he called you both to an account
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95393:27"/>
for your breach with him, in ſuffering the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to fall upon him contrary to agreement; truly this made your Brother and you uneaſie, as alſo the reſt of your bloody Rogues, for you were much afraid that he would not furniſh you with his purſe, according to the other agreement; but you and your Rogues with open cry proteſted your Innocency, and that you had not the leaſt thoughts of any ſuch Action, and truly, I did believe you were much in the right: Well, what to do you could not tell, for you were all of you ready to beſhit your ſelves; but this, Sir, you may remember, that you diſpatched away your truſty Meſſengers both to the French Court and to <hi>Holland,</hi> and promiſed upon the Faith of Gammer <hi>Potte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well then, what becomes of the Peace? Truly this Foil the Monſieur met withal did not retard the Peace, but rather further'd it, for your Ally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his buſineſs ſo well, by his Emiſſaries at the <hi>Hague</hi> amongſt the States, and with the Governor of <hi>Flanders, Villa Hermoſa,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> juſt as if the <hi>De Wits</hi> had been riſen from the dead, had poſitive Orders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Fight, if not before, not to go on any further, for that the Peace was concluded; from which Peace the States-General had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> yea, and <hi>England</hi> too, to have dated their ruine, as did appear by the fatal Conſequences of that Peace, had not God deſign'd a Deliverance for them all, and a Deliverer too: But your villanous, Popiſh and Popiſhly-affected Conſpirators ply'd their Work, and firſt got in the States General, then the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and then the Emperor, even to the abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Allies <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who were drawn into the War for the Common Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95393:28"/>
Truly here were ſtrange Diſcoveries of your gracious Intentions of ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing all <hi>Europe</hi> up in a perpetual bondage to the French Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Well, what do we with our Forces? ſurely they were well educated by this time: Was it not good Manners to call them home, ſince they had done the Work abroad? O yes, by all means our Forces muſt come home, or they would have been ſent home with a ſting in their Tails, for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> now was as unwilling to keep them as you was once to ſend them; and truly they were at laſt but courſely uſed; and therefore they being a parcel of caſe-harden'd Rogues, home they came, not to be disbanded, but to do the reſt of the work; for I am fully of opinion, that neither the States-General nor the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> were privy to the then glorious Deſign of forcing this Peace upon them. Well glad were you and the reſt of the Conſpirators to ſee the brave Boys come home in Companies and in Regiments, and great care you took to have them quarter'd about the Country; but the Inhabitants did not receive them with ſuch hearty welcome as you deſir'd, for upon their arrival you were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently plagned with the complaints of thoſe upon whom they were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Well, how then did you carry your ſelf, for here was a brave Army? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

firſt ought to ſit down and conſider the Coſt. And in a cloſe Cabal at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> upon a Couriers coming from <hi>France,</hi> ſoon after the Peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it was ſtrongly debated, Whether to try the Experiment for Mony with the Parliament, or to rely upon the French King, from whom your Brother and you, and the reſt of the Conſpirators, expected ſuch great matters; you may remember that in this Conſult there were three Factions, and three different Opinions amongſt them, tho' all the Rogues agreed in the main, That they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſo fair an Opportunity as now, yet they could never be ſure of their Game without Mony: And you know that more Mony you wanted.

Well, to be plain with you, it was my own dear ſelf, that makes this modeſt Addreſs to you; and if any one ſay, that ever I gave you one good word in my Life, I will be his humble Servant that proves it. Before I quit this Point, I muſt anſwer two Queſtions that have been ask'd me by ſeveral perſons: 1. What was the Opportunity I had of making this Diſcovery; and, 2. Why, or to what end, I made the Diſcovery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What the Opportunity was that I had of making the Diſcovery. And truly this I muſt ſay, and take Shame to my ſelf, the courſe I took to get into the Secrets of the Jeſuites, was no way warrantable from the Word of God, for I diſſembled my ſelf to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and yet was none, one that pretended Zeal for their Religion, and at that time was an avowed Enemy to them and their Religion. I have asked God forgiveneſs, and all true <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> I am ſure God hath pardon'd the Sin of his Servant, ſince he had no other thing before his Eyes, but the Good of his Country, and the Honour of God; tho' I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>to do the leaſt Evil, that the greateſt Good might come of it,</hi> is unlawful; and I am ſure there is no true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but what will not only forgive my doing that Evil, in joyning with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to diſcover the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns carried on by you and your Conſpirators, but will ſtand by my Truth that I did at that time diſcover. I have reaſon to bleſs God, for that they have given good Teſtimony of their Zeal for the Cauſe of God upon my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and reliev'd my Neceſſities, and viſited me when ſick and in Priſon, and were not aſham'd of my Chain: But I would not have any man to think, that tho' God was pleas'd to bleſs my poor Labours for the good of the Publick, to follow my Example, in joyning with that curſed Communion, tho' his deſign be never ſo honeſt, leſt God in Juſtice leave him to the Counſel of their own Wills.</p>
            <p>But it may be you are impatient, and therefore I ſhall haſten to my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded buſineſs, which is, to declare my ſelf fully to you, concerning the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities I had of diſcovering the curſed Intrigues of the Jeſuites, and the curſed Plot you carried on for the deſtruction of our Laws, Liberties, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95393:29"/>
I muſt tell you, that the acquaintance I had with ſome conſiderable <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in the Year 1670, made me ſuſpect a Deſign carried on by them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Religion, and to pull down ours, but I little thought they had a deſign of murdering the King, which in proceſs of time I found out; there was one <hi>Cotton,</hi> that was at Mr. <hi>Guildford</hi>'s in <hi>Kent,</hi> this Gentleman was a free-ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man, and would be often tempting me to come over to their Church, <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it will not be long before you muſt either burn or turn, therefore come over to us in time, that your Coming may be meritorious.</hi> This <hi>Cotton</hi> I in time found out to be a Prieſt of the Jeſuites Order, and one that was engaged in the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot,</hi> and when I was engaged, Sir, with your <hi>Coleman</hi> and the Society, I had with him a better acquaintance: From him, at firſt, I found that the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party had a Deſign then on foot to promote their Religion, and were making what Proſelytes they could, in order to enlarge their Intereſt and Power in this Kingdom. I from that time had a great deſire to get into them, to ſee whither their Deſigns tended, being very fearful that they deſign'd no leſs than the total ſubverſion of our Religion and Government, for this <hi>Cotton</hi> had the Impudence to tell me, That your Brother was engag'd with you and the <hi>Catholick Party,</hi> to advance your Cauſe and Religion, and was reſolv'd to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> it being a Religion that was moſt conſiſtent with Monarchy; and, that your Brother was reſolv'd to be like his Neighbour Princes. This was in the Year 1670, about <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> which Diſcourſe I diſcover'd to Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Drury,</hi> whom I did aſſiſt in the Service of his Cure at <hi>Sandhurſt,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> and he told me, that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> had talked as plainly, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe, to him, but he had ſufficiently told him his own, ſo that <hi>Cotton</hi> was ſhy of having any farther Diſcourſe with him about thoſe matters; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Mr. <hi>Drury</hi> having threatned to complain of him, Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> did withdraw from that Family; and another came in his room. In the Year 1672, I was acquainted with one <hi>Keimaſh,</hi> who uſed very perſwaſive Arguments to me, to have brought me over to their Church, he then frequented <hi>Arundel</hi> Houſe in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and was a Fellow that had inſinuated himſelf into the acquaintance of ſeveral Divines of the Church, and bragged, That he had reconciled above thirty Miniſters of the Ch. of <hi>England;</hi> but I found him a debauch'd lewd fellow, and ſo my acquaintance ceaſed with him, for it was a hard matter, unleſs in a Morning, to find him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ober. I found him afterwards to have been Chaplain to the old Counteſs of <hi>Arundel,</hi> with whom he liv'd ſeveral Years, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Steward. In the Year 1672, I left Mr. <hi>Drury</hi>'s Cure, and held a Living of my own, upon which I reſided for ſome time, call'd <hi>Bobbing,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and from thence I went and ſerv'd the King at Sea, as a Chaplain, where I found many difficulties, by reaſon of ſickneſs of Body; I refreſhed my ſelf at <hi>Tangier,</hi> where was one <hi>Gerard,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Dominican,</hi> that upon the firſt ſight of me enquir'd, whether the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> was eſtabliſh'd in <hi>England?</hi> (this was in the Year 1674, in the Month of <hi>April)</hi> I told him, No. <hi>Why then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Dutch War is to no purpoſe.</hi> Why, ſaid I, was our engaging in a War againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> to bring in <hi>Popery? Well, well,</hi> ſaid the Fryar, <hi>you will ſee</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:95393:30"/>
               <hi>in time.</hi> In ſome few days we had notice of a Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> of which I told the ſaid Fryar; <hi>What then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>our great King of</hi> France <hi>is not at peace with him, and he muſt do the work.</hi> In the Year 1675, I had obtain'd an Intereſt with <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> then Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Earl-Marſhal of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> who was very kind to me, upon the account of my contending earneſtly for his Right of preſenting to a Living in the Dioceſs of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> to which Living the then Biſhop (a turbulent man) pretended a Right of Collating; and in the Year 1676, I was made Chaplain to the ſaid Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> I think the whole Family will bear witneſs of my Fidelity to him and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. In the Service of the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> I came acquainted with ſeveral Prieſts, and being then reſolv'd upon a ſtrict enquiry into their deſigns againſt us, our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, I met with one <hi>Berry</hi> a Prieſt, that had been a Jeſuite, but had left that Order thro' ſome diſcontent and madneſs that had ſeiz'd the poor Wretch: I found him a poor zealous man, whoſe Zeal was far beyond his Knowledge; but this <hi>Berry</hi> brought me acquainted with Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> a Jeſuite, and <hi>John Keins,</hi> and <hi>Will. Morgan,</hi> that was then Prieſt to the Lord <hi>Powys,</hi> both Jeſuites, who gain'd my Conſent to go over to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and truly a few Arguments prevail'd with me, becauſe I had a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ire to ſee what they were doing, ſo that in ſome meaſure I might prevent that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending danger that ſeem'd to threaten <hi>England</hi> with no leſs than an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ruine: But this, as I ſaid before, was my great Evil, tho' my deſign in it was honeſt, juſt, and good; and, Sir, you know that it did turn to a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and would have turn'd to a better account, had not I met with your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, who was concern'd in all, and your Brother in every part but that of his own Life.</p>
            <p>But, in ſhort, I was by this <hi>Langworth</hi> reconcil'd to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> he was Father-Confeſſor to the Lord <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Upon my being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled I was brought to <hi>Richard Strange,</hi> then Provinciate of the Jeſuites, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me into the Society; and when I was admitted, it was reſolv'd by the Jeſuites, that I ſhould paſs the time of my <hi>Novitiate</hi> abroad in diſpatching buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Society, which I cheerfully accepted, as an advantageous Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing that for which I was reconcil'd and admitted into their Order, and therefore accordingly they provided for me. When I had paid Mr. <hi>Luke Roach,</hi> Commander of a <hi>Biſcay</hi> Merchant, bound for <hi>Bilboa,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Strange</hi> the Provincial gave me One hundred Piſtols for my ſupply, in order for my paſſage into <hi>Spain,</hi> and for my neceſſary Expences there, and order'd me what other Monies I ſhould need: I then apply'd my ſelf to a certain Nobleman, who was privy to my being reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had much preſſed me to it, in order to ſee what Work your Rogues were at: He paid into my hands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But this you may call to mind, that ſome of your deep-dy'd ſurſeited Rogues, had laid their deſign with you, for their bringing to paſs what you had deſigned about the King your Brother, he having ſo often failed you, and therefore you found, that he was not any longer to be truſted, and you had engaged them by ſeveral Demonſtrations that they might truſt you; therefore his diſpatch into the other World was determined; and further, that they would caſt the <hi>Odium</hi> of it upon the diſſenting Proteſtants; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, <hi>Claypool,</hi> as I have obſerved both in my firſt and this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and I ſeeing the Jeſuits ſo reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your Brother, I reſolved to do what I did. The King had private Information, as I ſaid before, in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but he made light of it, and inſtead of making ſtrick enquiry after the Diſcovery, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon accuſed, I found that was like to be ruined, for going ſo far by the Jeſuits; who becauſe Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> had been with the King, they thought it had been my ſelf who had the diſcovery communicated to you, and you communicated it to the Jeſuits and the Monks at the <hi>Savoy;</hi> and though the Affair was not communicated to the Council, till the Jeſuits ſhould have time enough if poſſible to ſtifle the diſcovery, and find out amongſt themſelves who it was that had deſigned to betray them, I being the man they miſtruſted, I thought it neceſſary to withdraw from their Company, and ſo with Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> I went to Juſtice <hi>Godfrey,</hi> as before, who had the Scheme of the Conſpiracy that was againſt the King's Life, which was ſo home and ſo full, that the ſaid Juſtice communicated it to an old friend of yours, who becauſe he would be in the Faſhion, ſlighted it as much as your gracious Brother had done, at the firſt diſcovery of it to him: and the ſaid Juſtice <hi>Godfrey</hi> communicated it to your ſweet ſelf, and you to your Prieſts and Jeſuits with you at <hi>Windſor,</hi> you know upon what account; and when <hi>Coleman</hi> came out of the Country, he had notice to do away his Papers, but the vain glorious Puppy kept them, but ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators obeyed you, and conveyed themſelves away; but Juſtice <hi>Godfrey</hi> being in ſome meaſure Maſter of the Information, tells <hi>Coleman,</hi> with whom he was intimate, of the thing, but <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and adviſed the Juſtice to meddle no further in the Buſineſs, for that he would find but little Encouragement or Thanks for his pains, for their Game was ſure, and gone too far, and too great perſons concerned in it to value any thing that could be done: This ſurpriſed Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey</hi> who was always looked upon a very fair Gentleman, and zealous for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not any way inclining to Popery, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it fair to all, and the Papiſts themſelves had a great eſteem of him as well as others; but he finding your Friend, who was privy to the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, had done nothing in the Affair, communicated it to the Privy Council on the 28 of <hi>September</hi> in the morning, and as I told you before, I was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Council at night; how I carried my ſelf, if any of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil be alive, they will juſtifie me; that although I was ſufficiently Brow-beaten, and met with great oppoſition from ſome, yet I ſtood to my point, and gave ſuch clear Demonſtrations, that they were conſtrained (tho' full fore againſt their will) to grant their Warrants to ſeize ſome of the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that night, which made ſome talk of a Popiſh Plot, but few or none except the Conſpirators themſelves knew at firſt what to make of it; the Papiſts were ſo bold as to laugh at it and deride it, and <hi>Coleman</hi> who was your Factor in all the Popiſh Plot, did go into the City and ſtrutted as if he knew as little of the Buſineſs as your ſelf; however, there were thirty ſix Bags of his Papers ſeized, and he appearing before the Council in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, upon a Summons only, ſuch was his Intereſt with the Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, that he himſelf thought it was out of the Power of Man to hurt him, eſpecially ſince many of that Council, then alive, were themſelves engaged in the General Plot: upon this Preſumption he appeared and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hector and bounce at the Council, telling them, that in accuſing him they ſtruck at his Maſter; yet for all his he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We having got your great <hi>Goliah</hi> into <hi>Newgate,</hi> you thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that all poſſible care ſhould be taken, both as to the cauſe in general, and your friend in particular; you gave Inſtructions to all you could, to hide their Papers, and ſeveral of them were brought to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where they were carefully preſerved, and to ſend away all you durſt not truſt; nay, rather than fail, old <hi>Coventry,</hi> your never-failing League-breaker, he lent you a caſt of his Office, and granted your Conſpirators paſſes, if they were diſpoſed to beat upon the Hoof; nay, you took great Care, that the Witneſſes ſhould not want all the diſcouragement that might be; nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fail, ſome of the Clerks of the Council were ſet as Spies upon them, and the very Minutes of the Council were made uſe of to inſnare them, and the Honeſt Clerks themſelves witneſſes againſt them for the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Oh! but your dear friend <hi>Coleman</hi> was committed; Ay, he was; what then, was it not high time? Yes, he was committed, and you were not idle; yet for all this, you and your Rogues did not doubt but to rub it off, and to carry your Point, for all your Creatures were in Places of Truſt about
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95393:32"/>
your Brother the King, and his Council, by whoſe help you and they got your writings of the chiefeſt Import that concerned your ſelf and greater Conſpirators ſo well ſecured, that whatever became of the ſcoundrel Prieſts and Jeſuits, yet you doubted not but to ſave the principal part of the <hi>Cargo;</hi> and therefore what concerned your ſelf in relation to your Trayterous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies with the Pope, or the French King, and others which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Popiſh Lords, never appeared, except the Lord <hi>Berkſhire's</hi> Letters, and there being but one poſitive Witneſs at firſt, you were extremely pleaſed with the hopes of baffling the diſcovery of your Conſpiracy, but before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Parliament, there was but one great Block in your way, and that was the vain glorious Diſcovery <hi>Coleman</hi> had made to Sir <hi>Edmund Bury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> of this you were to take Care: In order to this, the Parliaments meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was put off from the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> till the <hi>21ſt</hi> of the ſaid Month.</p>
            <p>Well then, how did your good Friend <hi>Coleman</hi> carry himſelf in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, truely good man he was very Melancholly, and was upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſed to diſcover all the Intrigue from the beginning to the end, of which, Sir, you and your Crew were extremely jealous; nay, in ſuch diſorder that at your <hi>Newmarket</hi> Sports, you were more concerned for him than a little, but what was to be done in this Caſe, I muſt ſay that for you, by your Command, word was ſent to <hi>Coleman</hi> to be of good cheer, a way would be found to ſecure <hi>Godfr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Truly you were in a ſad pickle, here was a lamentable Kettle of Fiſh upon the Fire; What muſt be done in this caſe, that the Cookery be not expos'd to the next meeting of Parliament? Indeed, you and your Jeſuites were againſt the meeting of the Parliament, but were zealous to have the Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued till the Spring of the Year, and by that time you hoped the Cloud would be blown over: And furthermore you judged, that if the Parliament met, they would be meddling with this Plot: And you were pretty much in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95393:32"/>
the right of it, for they had reaſon enough to enquire into the buſineſs. But on the other hand, your Friend the Briber, and Mrs. <hi>Remarkable</hi> his Spouſe, (who by the way was in her Life-time as true a Politician as ever piſs'd) they were for the ſitting of the Parliament, and for very good reaſon (if you did but know all) that Mony might be rais'd to pay the Army, which had run you out at Heels extreamly: And your Ally the French King, notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his Purſe, ſince his Work was done, he did not lend you a lift at this time, tho' your Intereſt and his was ſo inſeparably joyn'd and link'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but you had ſome Aſſurance that the Parliament would give no Mony to maintain, whatever they gave to disband; ſo that your Condition was but ill, and what to do you knew not: At laſt, old <hi>Veracity,</hi> with his Jewiſh Face, thought of an excellent Expedient, which was, That your old Friend Mr. <hi>Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaws</hi> ſhould do what he could to bring them into a good Humor, and give them a ſmall Spell, as a Token of a future Bleſſing that would fall upon them at the end of the Seſſion: And a Parliament of your humble Penſioners was held you know where, and ſo did <hi>Lamaz,</hi> and there was a jolly meeting of all the Club of Voters, and an admirable Entertainment was had for the Rogues, and ſome Guin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as were diſtributed, and all was well, and Advice was taken that the Army ſhould have its due Praiſe; but old <hi>Grouthead,</hi> your Scotch Favourite, he advis'd the ſitting of the Parliament, and that the Plot it ſelf ſhould be made uſe of as a Cripple to beg Mony withal, and to beg for a round Sum, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as religious a regard for the Penſioners being gratified, as that old Mrs. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,</hi> Spouſe to Mr. <hi>Thinjaws,</hi> ſhould have a Sum of Mony to buy her ſome reverend Winter-rigging for her ſelf and Fry of both Sexes; ſo that, in a word, it was carried for the Parliaments ſitting.</p>
            <p>The Parliaments meeting being very near, the King your Brother ſent for me, to diſcourſe me at the Prince's Lodgings in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> who was very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to know of me who it was that maintain'd me abroad at that rate that I had liv'd; but I refus'd to anſwer to that Queſtion, but told the King in the preſence of the Prince, That I doubted, notwithſtanding all the Efforts that I had made to preſerve him, he would be deſtroy'd by the <hi>Popiſh Party;</hi> and ſince His Majeſty was pleas'd to make light of it, I told him, that I would if he pleas'd give him ſome Reaſons why they had ſuch a Deſign on foot; to which your Brother conſented; and one Reaſon I gave, was, becauſe he had made ſuch Promiſes to them, and aſſur'd them, that he was theirs, and that he was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to the Ch. of <hi>Rome</hi> when beyond Sea, as I had ſeen by his Letters; but the King bid me ſay nothing of that: he declar'd to me, upon the word of a King, that now he did believe that they had a deſign to murder him, and owned that he had written ſuch Letters as I then intimated to him, and withal told me, that if I had come to him privately, and acquainted him with the Plot, he would of himſelf have claſhed it; and tho' I had deſign'd well, yet the diſcovery of it had created a Jealouſie in the People concerning him. Then I acquainted him that I had ſeen his Letters to the Nuns at <hi>Ghent,</hi> when he borrow'd Mony of them, for which they waited ſeveral years here in <hi>England:</hi> in thoſe Letters he did declare to them, That he would reſtore their Religion when he came to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95393:33"/>
his Right; and that was another reaſon why they would deſtroy him: And that <hi>St. Germain,</hi> a French Jeſuite, had a hand in the Murder of Mr. <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lligrew's</hi> Man, when he lay upon the Couch in His Majeſty's Cloak. Here the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted me, and commanded me to take no farther notice of that buſineſs, and declar'd he knew more than I could tell him in that affair of <hi>Killigrew's</hi> Man; but he harped much upon the great Jealouſie that the People had of him, and that it was much encreas'd by ill men, that did labour to poſſeſs the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds againſt him, and ſaid, that unleſs extraordinary care was taken, the <hi>Fanatick Party</hi> would rebel; and inveigh'd very much againſt the Diſſenters, and ſaid, that he thought himſelf in as much danger from them as from the <hi>Popiſh Party.</hi> And many things paſſed betwixt the King your Brother and my ſelf of this nature, and he told me, that the Parliament was ready to meet, and he did not queſtion but that they would take upon them the examination of the Plot, and that if I carried it prudently before them, I ſhould never want a Friend of him; and whereas I had not acquainted him as yet with the Names of the Great Men concern'd, I would then tell him. But truly, Sir, I with all decency to the Publick refus'd to tell your Brother any thing more, but told him, the Parliament would have the Examination of the Plot, and therefore they ſhould have the Names of the great Lords concern'd in it. The King parted from me in a heat, and the Prince commended me for keeping their Names conceal'd; and, I ſuppoſe, according to his uſual way, he graciouſly communicated this Diſcourſe to you, for the next time you met with me you ſhew'd all the Lines of your ſilly Face to be enrag'd againſt me, and gave me ſome hard words, which I did not well hear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Parliaments</hi> day came on, and I well remember what a Sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> there was at <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s lodging that morning, and that Whore had adviſed my being cloſe confined, but I went to ſee how the Jade looked that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to thank her for the counſel ſhe gave the King, but I would not ſee her, and there I was forced to ſalute her by proxy, and gave her two or three of her right Names, and eke mine and the Nations Bleſſing, and returning to my Lodgings, I met with your good ſelf, and I ſaw much Guilt in your Face, and you gave me an ill look or two, and ſo I fairly got rid of the ſweet Face of you, but this I muſt have you to remember, that the King your Brother would have given me any thing that I could have asked, if I would have fained my ſelf ſick, and not to have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament, but that would not take with me, for I was reſolved not to loſe two years Labour to comply with him, for I had the publick good upon my Soul, and that God knows was my main deſign.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being met, you know that the old Gentleman made a gracious Speech to both Houſes, and after that he had given ſome of your Conſpirators reaſons for the keeping up of his Army, he then tells them of the Jeſuits Plot, but not a word of yours and <hi>Coleman,</hi> and ſaid that he left the Jeſuits to the Law, and that he would take as much care to prevent all manner of ill Practices of thoſe men, and others too, who had
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95393:33"/>
been tampering in a high degree with Forreigners to introduce Popery; by this Sir he brought himſelf into the Plot, and ſo much ſhall ſerve for his Speech: After him <hi>Roſcius</hi> enters with his Knaves Face, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the Parliament with the neceſſity of the Governments breaking the Law in keeping up the Army, and tells them they muſt be contented with it for this time, and not only ſo, but they muſt pay for it too; nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, impudently tells them they could not but be well pleaſed with it into the bargain: I wonder that ever a King would ſit on a Throne with Patience, to hear the Logger-head make ſome fulſome nonſenſical Speech as that was; nay, if you had but obſerved with what a ſhitten Countenance he brought in a poor mauled damned Plot to beg mony withal, and oh! with what humble Grimmaces, he addreſſed the Houſe of Commons, as if the Villain had lain under the Guilt of a Thouſand Burglaries; but the Houſe of Commons finding the Note extreamly changed from what it was at their laſt parting, they immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ely fell upon that part of the King's Speech that related to the <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> and mighty angry they were at the violating the Law, and miſuſing the Mony given for the disbanding of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Well, both Houſes ſet to it with all diligence, and looked into the <hi>Plot,</hi> that they might find out all the Authors of the Nations Miſery and Ruine; and in order to find out the bottom of this Helliſh Conſpiracy, they appointed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees to inſpect, and find out, and enquire into the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> and Addreſſes from both Houſes were almoſt every day voted, for the baniſhing of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or to have the Papers relating to the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> deliver'd to them to examine, and to have the Militia of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> raiſed, and Pardons for the Witneſſes. And to all Human Reaſon you and your Raſcally Crew appear'd to be but in a naſty condition. And truly the Plot took ſo much of the Parliaments time, that there was ſcarce leiſure to make one motion for a Supply, inſomuch that <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and her Servant <hi>Nell</hi> talked of retrenching their Expences; And what was the matter? The Whores ſaw that the Parliament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound that all Care was little enough to diſcover what had been acted by your Villains, and to come at the bottom to know who they were, and then to take care for further preſervation. Lord, what Change was here! the two Houſes had no longer hard Thoughts of the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> was their only Trouble.</p>
            <p>Come Sir, wipe that ſweaty Face of yours, and don't cry, here's a word of Comfort for you, read on a little. Were the Houſes of Parliament ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent?

Friend of yours, the Rogue is not yet hang'd, but the Gallows hath groan'd for him many a Year; if you will not believe me, you may ask my Lady <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feries.</hi> And, to give you and your Rogues your due, you conceal'd every thing you could get conceal'd; ſuch was your diligence; but yet as much as you did conceal, there was enough left to ſhew the World that there was a <hi>Plot,</hi> and a villanous one, and that you were at the head of it, in order to root up the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and deſtroy the Government, which oblig'd the Houſe to ſend for the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> privately, who ſign'd Warrants for the apprehending ſeveral <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords, and committed them to ſeveral Priſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Town. And another Gentleman being under conſideration, which at laſt came to an Accuſation and an Impeachment, for that it was found out by his Letters, the Intrigues he held with your Ally for Mony to procure a Peace, and deceive the Parliament; which Letters were preſerv'd and brought into the Houſe by the procurement of a worthy Gentleman, ſince a Peer of the Realm, who had wiſely kept them againſt a rainy day; upon which many of the open caſe-harden'd Rogues began to trudge beyond the Seas, and ſome of your Plotters found it too hot for <hi>England</hi> to hold them; for the Murther of Juſtice <hi>Godfrey</hi> ſtuck upon our Stomachs, without the leaſt proſpect of being digeſted; and ſeveral of his Murtherers did travel, for fear of being call'd to an account for that bloody piece of Villany, or of being in the <hi>Plot</hi> to murther the King. And to give you your due, you did beſtir your ſelf; and that the Journeys of theſe your Villains might be more eaſie, you had a couple of good-natur'd Rogues, that made no Bones to oblige you with a caſt of their Office, that theſe Vermin might not be ſtopt in their way, by which they would have endanger'd themſelves and you too, and loſt their Cauſe, in which they had been true Drudges to your Brother and your ſelf. You did alſo take more than ſpecial care for the ſecuring a jolly number of Jeſuites, who were bleſt with the ſame Fortune, by the Aſſiſtance of your aforeſaid Hell hounds, to get over the Herring pond. I commend the Diligence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, but the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> were too many for them, for the Miniſtry at that time of the day, to ſerve you, were willing to help their Brethren in Iniquity; and as the Parliament were ready to detect the black piece of Villany you and theſe Rogues were engag'd in, the Court and the Conſpirators were as diligent to conceal, if not, on the contrary, far to outdo them in ſupplanting the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Truly, to give the Houſe of Lords their due, they acted with as much Prudence as the Commons; they appointed a ſecret Committee, conſiſting of five or ſix Lords, and by this Committee, whilſt it was a ſecret one, and whilſt they kept their Examinations private, they did diſcover your ſweet ſelf (God bleſs you) and the Queen-Dowager to be in the bottom of the Deſign: And the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> having for ſome conſiderable time had a Scheme of the Conſpiracy from my ſelf, he well underſtood how to manage the Diſcovery to a Hairs breadth, and he certainly did it with admirable dexterity, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all men of whom there was the leaſt ſuſpicion, by which method ſeveral things were diſcover'd to that Committee, which would otherwiſe never have come to

After the Parliament was riſen, you poſſeſſed your Brother with the danger of the Bill, and whatever he did, he ſhould not paſs it, for it was too great a Truſt to be repoſed in the People, and that it would be of a ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to himſelf. No, Sir, you were out, the true danger would have been yours, and not the King's; and your Brother knew it well enough, and he therefore was as willing to deny the paſſing the Bill as you and your Rogues were to have him. The Bill being rejected, your Brother was troubled at the Parliaments reſenting the refuſal of the paſſing ſo neceſſary a Bill; then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wheedle with the Parliament, and declar'd, that he was ready to aſſent to any Bill that he ſhould have tender'd to him for the ſecurity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the Militia; ſo that the whole power of calling or not calling, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not continuing them together, during the time limited, was in him, and that he might be the ſole Judge of the publick Security: So we thank'd him for nothing, and the buſineſs fell.</p>

Upon his

            <p n="2">2.

What if the Queen-Dowager were in it, and you and the Court-Whores, and the Court pimps, and Court-Bawds, and ſome of the Miniſters of State and Juſtice, and your villanous Council at St <hi>James</hi>'s, muſt they not be detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Were we to be afraid to ſpeak the Truth? No, Sir, it was not high time to ſpeak Truth: Yes, Sir, it was high time, and more than high time. But yet your Brother, good man, to ſave you and your party, did in the month of <hi>November,</hi> 1678, offer me at Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi>'s Apartment, the Biſhoprick of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and alſo promiſed me the Favour of advancing me, if I would deſiſt this Enterprize, as he call'd the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> aſſuring me, that it would not be for his Service, becauſe of the heat it would put the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and further told me, That the <hi>Parliament</hi> would forſake me, and not do any thing for me, and if I had a Thought of complying with him, I ſhould meet him at the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Lodgings; but I went to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and told him what the King had ſaid, who when he heard me give him an account of what the King had offer'd me, and upon what terms, <hi>The poor man,</hi> ſaid the Prince, <hi>do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

nor make with any thing of that Nature; for ſaid the Prince either he will cheat or expoſe you, or if he be real, there is an old Wife in the caſe, who will be ſet on you to draw you off from the good work you have began, or perhaps to do that which is worſe, and ſo I refuſed that offer; and let me tell you farther, that upon the diſcovery of the Plot, ſeveral Papers were found at the Houſe of one <hi>Jolliff</hi> a Taylor: I did obſerve that <hi>CHARLES</hi> I. of Bleſſed Memory, had commiſſionated ſeveral of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to Riſe, and withal I ſaw the Inſtructions that were given to them, to give the Engliſh no quarter; and I ſaw a Letter of your Fathers to the Biſhop of <hi>Caſal,</hi> as near as I can remember, wherein he promiſed his Catholick Subjects, that if he were driven through the neceſſity of Affairs to cauſe a Ceſſation of Arms, it ſhould not be for the Diſadvantage of his Iriſh Catholick Subjects, but to let them have a little time to breath, ſo that they might be the better able to ſerve him and themſelves againſt the Factious Engliſh there, (if there ſhould be any remaining amongſt them) all which were carried to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and what became of them I know not: I ſaw alſo in thoſe Papers, found as aforeſaid at the Houſe of the ſaid <hi>Jollife,</hi> ſeveral Paſſes given to thoſe of the Rebels, that fled out of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the reducing of that Country, and notwithſtanding they had ſhed much Proteſtant Blood, they were by your Brother and you recommended to ſeveral Miniſters of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſeveral other Princes of the Romiſh Religion, as perſons that had ſerved your Father in reducing their Country to the Obedience of the Catholick Church, and that had contributed much to the deſtroying of the Engliſh Hereticks, that had planted themſelves in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to obſerve farther to you, that the Jeſuits did tell me, that the coming over of the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta,</hi> was in order to make way, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the Catholick Religion here in <hi>England,</hi> and that the Breach of the peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi> was by you and her contrived, and by the late King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, in order to reduce thoſe States to the Catholick Faith, and that it was thought fit to begin the Exerciſe of the Romiſh Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to grant a general Toleration here, in order to which ſixteen hundred Prieſts of all orders were ſent over from divers Nations, and that the moſt of 'em were kept here on a maintenance for ſecret Service, and others by your ſelf in half Pay, as diſbanded Officers, but this being all defeated by Parliament, by your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Aſſent, they were much irritated againſt the King your Brother, and ſo was your ſweet ſelf; and furthermore the Jeſuits acquainted me, that the King your Brother had diſpatched an Envoy to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to engage him in the Catholick League; for at that time the Catholick Princes as he ſaid, were reſolved to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion, and that the French King, and your Brother, and your ſelf, were Heads of this League, which League they ſaid your Brother had not carefully kept, and obſerved, but had given way to his impertinent Parliaments; but that they might not hinder this good Deſign, the French King had agreed to your Requeſt of 300000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for 3 years, if by any means your Brother might be diſpatched out of the way, there being
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95393:36"/>
no manner of truſt to be put in him, and that he was not only unfaithful in all his Promiſes, and Oaths, made to them the ſaid Jeſuits, and Catholicks, but was an Apoſtate from the Catholick Religion, and therefore not to be endured any longer: This Negotiation of the mony Part of the Conſpiracy, and killing your Brother was carried on by the Lord <hi>Powy</hi>'s, and the late Earl of <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> and <hi>Coleman,</hi> and St. <hi>Germain</hi> the Jeſuit, by, and with the advice of the Jeſuits, and thoſe of your Council at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and your good worthy ſelf: It will not be inconvenient to put you in mind, that your Brother was a mortal Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Proteſtant Religion, and the way of Governments by Parliaments; for do but obſerve a Letter of his to the French King bearing date in <hi>June</hi> 1676. in which he ſaith to this Effect.</p>
            <p>That if he could be aſſured of a Penſion that might continue, he ſhould not continue that way of governing, <hi>viz.</hi> by frequent Parliaments, which at the beſt was but a clamorous Rabble, that took upon them to direct Kings, but as he was reſolved to be like his Neighbours in Riches and Grandeur, ſo he was reſolved to be like them in Religion too: This was the Effect and Subſtance of that Letter that was ſhewed to me by <hi>John Keins,</hi> and <hi>Baſil Langworth;</hi> but ſaid <hi>Keins,</hi> the French King was too old to be cullied out of his Mony, by a man that was ſo uncertain: All theſe things I communicated to the King your Brother in private, in the Princes Lodging in <hi>White-hall,</hi> who gave me Thanks for not communicating theſe Things to the Parliament, and told me that he was now fully convinced of the Reaſons and Grounds the Papiſts had of taking away his Life; and the Prince ſaid, I pray God continue your Majeſty on that Opinion, for now you may ſee they are a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are not to be endured in a civil Government: Good God, ſaid the King your Brother, is this the kindneſs that is to be ſhewed me for all the favours that I have ſhewed that people? At which his Majeſty wept; the Prince then bid me withdraw, and ſent for me the next day, and conjured me not to communicate one word of the Diſcourſe I had with the King; for, ſaith he, it will be neither ſafe for the King, nor you, nor any of us, if this ſhould be reported: And alſo his Highneſs the Prince had often enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and engaged me, that when I met with any thing that might reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King to be ſparing there, becauſe the Publication of thoſe things might tend to alienate the King's Heart from the frequent uſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without which, the Kingdom could never rid it ſelf from the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Danger of Popery: But when the Prince ſaw how the Parliaments, and the whole Nation were treated by him, and your ſelf, and villanous Party, he heartily repented of his Injunction laid on me, and ſo did I of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to him; there were three great Reaſons why it was neceſſary that this Plot ſhould at that time be diſcovered: 1. That the Life of the King your Brother might be preſerved, if he had ſo pleas'd. 2. To ſhew to the World what a ſort of men you herded withal, and what we were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you, when ever you ſhould come to the Crown. 3. To prevent, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſuch an Enemy of our Religion and Government. 4. For the Diſcharge of my Conſcience to God and my Country, and that ſuch Malefactors might be brought to publick Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the Life of your Brother might have been preſerved, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had been ſo pleaſed; in order to this, it was highly neceſſary, that the Kingdom ſhould be awakened to provide in all legal and due ways, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the perſon of the King your Brother; you may if you will, remember that you had brought the Nation into ſuch a Lethargick State and Condition, as did not only amaze thoſe that loved it, but encouraged alſo thoſe that hated it; they were much out who thought that your villainous Crew had laid their Deſigns aſide, when your Brother ſent out a ſham Proclamation againſt Prieſts and Jeſuits, or when the Penſioners had given <hi>Popery</hi> a broad ſide in the Houſe of Commons, in order to make their Meaſures come in the more freely, or when the laſt Bill paſſed in the year 1673, though that Bill did them no manner of Service in the World, but hurt: Alas good Sir, you and your Villains, by theſe ſleepy proceedings of the then <hi>Parliament,</hi> were prick'd on to be the more induſtrious in the purſuit of your wicked Deſigns, you and your Accomplices had ſo ſtated your Caſe, that there could be no retreat; and rather than you would be deſeated of your Hopes, you and your Villains were reſolved to pawn your Lives and Fortunes, and your all, upon your great Adventure; for you had laboured too long in the Deſign, which you had brought to bear ſo well, to loſe in a moment the Fruits of Seven, Eight or Ten years Toils and Endeavours; for ſuppoſe, Sir, the <hi>Proteſtant Party</hi> ſhould have been ſo good natured, as to have forgiven you and your Accomplices, yet you could not have relyed upon their mercy, becauſe you had proceeded ſo far in this Conſpiracy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you being well fraught with ſuch a <hi>Cargo</hi> of Guilt, what could be expected from you, but your being deſperate to the laſt degree? And therefore, ſince you knew that not <hi>Lawrel,</hi> but <hi>Hemp</hi> was the reward of Treaſon, your Party were reſolved not to be diſmayed at the Horrour of your Treaſons, but were rather inflamed to revenge your ſelves upon the Parliament, that ſometimes barked againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> you knew very well what you and your Villains had deſerved, and rather than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>amely to ſuffer the publick Juſtice of the Nation, you were reſolved not to be without the Aid and Aſſiſtance of a Forreign Power, and every man that was not a Stranger to Converſation, could not but hear what large Contributions were provided for you in all <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Countries, upon which you and your party were notoriouſly impudent, which was no ſign of your Innocence, but of your Villany, and the Aſſurance you had of compleating the Nations R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ine, and though they had brought the King your Brother to that State, that he would not believe, if any Malecontent ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your Deſigns, either againſt him, or the Government, both in Church and State; yet there was none but in that Day, before any diſcovery was made, ſaw the Deſign in general, and that your Brother as well as you was engaged in it, and becauſe he had forſeited his Credit with you and your Accomplices,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95393:37"/>
your <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> thought him not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſo, it was then neceſſary that the Government ſhould not only diſengage him from that wicked Enterpriſe, and that he might not periſh; it was neceſſary that your Deſigns againſt him in particular ſhould alſo be detected.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Another Reaſon of this diſcovery, was, to ſhew to the world what ſort of Men they were with whom you herded, and what we were to expect from you, when ever you came to the Crown; for you that was a Traytor to the Kingdom by thoſe curſed Deſigns of yours, when you was a Subject, would of Conſequence be a Tyrant, whenever you mounted the Throne; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that judged you a bigotted Papiſt, did not conclude you a Traytor, till your deſigns were diſcovered, and then they could expect nothing leſs of you, than an Arbitrary and Diſpotick Reign, when you ſhould come to wear the Crown; hence it was, that upon the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> that the Parliament voted that your being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and the Hopes you gave the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> of coming ſuch to the Crown, had encouraged them in this wicked Conſpiracy, and though in Civility to your Brother, they did not impeach you for your Treaſons, yet they thought it neceſſary to prevent your coming by a Bill of Excluſion; but on the contrary had not your Deſigns been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the Nation muſt have ſunk by your Trayterous Deſigns, and have been ruined without any impoſſibility of recovery, but tho' the diſcovery had not its deſired Effect, yet it did ſo much affect you, that when you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Throne by the murther of your Brother, that you could not make that conſiderable Progreſs in your Work, for then you ſaw plainly, you had received a deadly wound, of which you could by no means be cured, for the Nation ſaw who they were you had eſpouſed, and therefore they were aware both of you and them, and made your own Conſpiracy to be a Plague to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may ſay, how can this be a good Ground or Reaſon for the diſcovery of ſuch a deſign? When there was but few that believed it, and that the King your Brother laught at the <hi>Plot,</hi> as a matter wholly Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>1. It is well known that your Brother laughed at the <hi>Plot,</hi> and would have made ſome to have believed that it was Fabulous, but he well knew that he was engaged in every part of it, but that of his own Life, and that he was too conſcious to himſelf, he had diſobliged you and your party by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo looſe and negligent in the performance of thoſe promiſes he had made to you and your <hi>Party;</hi> and to get a ſum of Money from the <hi>Paliament,</hi> he would let the <hi>Parliament</hi> worry your Friends; nay, rather than go without it, he would himſelf give your Cauſe a gentle Stab; wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I pray obſerve your Brother's Proclamation <hi>Octob.</hi> 30, 1678, where he called your Conſpiracy <hi>a Bloody and Trayterous Deſign of Popiſh Recuſants</hi> (of which, Sir, you were the Head) <hi>againſt his Perſon and Government, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.</hi> Again, in his Proclamation of <hi>November</hi> the 20th 1678, did he not declare, That <hi>the Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuites lurking within the Realm had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and ſet on foot divers trayterous Plots and Deſigns againſt his Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Proteſtant Religion by Law eſtabliſh'd?</hi> Again obſerve, Sir, his Proclamation for a Faſt, <hi>March</hi> the 28th, 1679, where he declar'd, That <hi>through the impious and malicious Conſpiracy of the Popiſh Party, there was a Plot not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Deſtruction of his Royal Perſon, but the total Subverſion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the true Proteſtant Religion within the Realm by Law eſtabliſh'd.</hi>

            <p>So that I may again ſay, that there was a neceſſity of diſcovering of that Plot, in order to ſhew to the whole Nation what thoſe men were with whom you herded and were engag'd, in order to our deſtruction; and I inſiſt the more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, becauſe of the great Loyalty to which they pretended, and for which they were countenanc'd by your Brother and you, in oppoſition to all Law and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whilſt other faithful men, with their Families, were left to periſh for want of Bread, who had ſerv'd your Father, your Brother, and you, without the leaſt recompence for their Service; and that the Nation might be undeceiv'd in that reſpect as well as in others, that they might ſee they were no Changelings, but were full of the ſame Devil their Forefathers had; and if they did conceal him, it was for want of an Opportunity, and they were about to ſhew what they would be at, but I was beforehand with them, and then the Nation was fully ſatisfied concerning their Loyalty.

I am ſure you cannot bite no more than your dead Dog <hi>Mumper;</hi> I pray let us have your Thought for once; I warrant you, you have ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Queſtion to ask; it may be you ſtill inſiſt upon being ſatisfied, why, if it were ſo neceſſary to have it known that your Crew were not men of that Loyalty they pretended, why then were not the Witneſſes better receiv'd by the King your Brother, who the laſt moment of his Life was ſatisfied of the Innocency of the <hi>Roman Catholicks?</hi> Truly, Sir, there were ſeveral reaſons why the King your Brother, it may be, might not receive the witneſſes ſo well, and believe them as he ought to have done; 1. Becauſe he was engag'd in the whole Conſpiracy of introducing Popery and Slavery, but was not privy to that part which related to his own Life: 2. Your Brother lov'd to appear a Prince of Mercy and Clemency, tho' he had not one dram of thoſe Princely Virtues, but what his meer Cowardice compel'd him to: 3. The Nature of the Evidence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: 4. The Intereſt of the Conſpirators. Theſe you ſhall have in due time, and not before, tho' you cry your Eyes out.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Reaſon, why it was neceſſary that your Conſpiracy ſhould be diſcover'd, was, to prevent your coming to the Crown; for, certainly it could be neither ſafe nor proper to ſet a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Head over a <hi>Proteſtart</hi> Intereſt, eſpecially ſince you had made ſo many Attempts upon the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> to deſtroy it, and in order, to its deſtruction made ſuch an Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> as I have at large already made out, in which I think you are as fully expos'd as your Heart and Soul can wiſh; and therefore, Sir, I think you no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(4) That I might diſcharge a good Conſcience, and that ſuch Malefactors might be brought to publick Juſtice. It is well known, Sir, that the King your Brother was a Favourer of the <hi>Popiſh Intereſt,</hi> as being the greateſt Favourers of Monarchy, and he was pleas'd himſelf to offer to reconcile me to that Party, and told me, That if I would engage, upon the word of a Miniſter, not to bear any Teſtimony againſt thoſe I had accuſed before the Council, but would be rul'd by him, I ſhould have Ten thouſand pounds to buy me an Annuity; and if I would, I ſhould retire to any College in either Univerſity, and live there quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; urging to me, that a Parliament would never gratifie me, and that it was in his power only to ſhew me Favour, and therefore adviſed me to follow his Directions, and if I did, it would be impoſſible for me to miſcarry. To this I thus reply'd, I humbly thank your Majeſty for your Grace and Favour, and I ſhould willingly accept of your Royal Offer, were it not the higheſt Breach of Truſt repoſed in me by your Commons in this <hi>Parliament;</hi> beſides, Sir, ſaid I, your Nobles in the Houſe of Peers muſt, and ſo will all Mankind, judge me the worſt of Men, if I ſhould ſo baſely deſert my Cauſe: It is plain that the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> have a Deſign againſt your Majeſties Life, and all our Lives, Liberties, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and therefore, by the Grace of God, I will ſtand by the Cauſe to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of my power, to the laſt minute of my Life. I bleſs God for the Grace of Perſeverance; I have diſcharg'd a good Conſcience, and tho' I was left by your Brother, and perſecuted by you, yet your Villains were ſome of them brought to publick Juſtice, and made Examples for their many notorious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the Religion, Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I now come to ſhew you what Evidence there was to prove this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that you were engag'd in for the deſtruction of the Perſon of the King, and for the bringing in of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. The conſtant bloody Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a Teſtimony ſufficient to have convicted them of being guilty of ſuch a horrid Conſpiracy; for do but remember how that Apoſtatical Synagogue of Satan will not bear with any Kingdom, Common-wealth, or Community of Men that differs from them in Matters of Religion, and declares againſt them as Antichriſtian and Idolaters, but thoſe who ſo declare are immediately pronounced Hereticks, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95393:39"/>
               <hi>de jure</hi> they are excommunicated as ſuch, according to the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third; and by an Edict of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth in the Year of our Lord 1558; and if that be not ſufficient, you may remember that we are in the <hi>Bulla Coena Domini,</hi> which your Holy Father at <hi>Rome</hi> cauſeth to be read every <hi>Maunday Thurſday,</hi> and there we are ſolemnly curſed; and thereupon, Sir, your bloody Party and your ſelf, and all other Papiſts living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominions of Proteſtant Princes, were not only diſcharg'd from all Allegiance to Proteſtant Princes, but all of you were, and ſtill are, bound by the ſtricteſt Bond of Conſcience, upon pain of being damn'd, to depoſe ſuch Heretical Princes: And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the third hath taught you and them, that they are ſo far from being guilty of Murder, that they are obliged to kill any who ſtand excommunicate, and are bound to extirpate Hereticks, as they would be eſteem'd Chriſtians themſelves. Nay further, do but obſerve the Bull of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the tenth, wherein you may, if you pleaſe, ſee plainly, that it is a Crime of the deepeſt dye for a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> to be loyal to a <hi>Proteſtant Prince;</hi> nay, ſuch are publickly curſed in the view of the World: ſo that it is apparent that no <hi>Proteſtant Government</hi> can be ſafe where ſuch a number of Men have a Being, and are in any manner countenanc'd. Again, <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> your great Cardinal, tells you in words at length, and is ſo impudently plain, that a man of an Iriſh Underſtanding may know his meaning, his words are theſe; <hi>Hereticks are to be deſtroy'd Root and Branch, if it can poſſibly be done; but if it appears that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks are ſo few, that they cannot conveniently with their own ſafety attempt ſuch a thing, then in ſuch a caſe it is beſt to be quiet. (de Laicis,</hi> Lib. 3, Ep. 22.) Leſt upon oppoſition made by Hereticks, the Catholicks ſhould be worſted. And from hence <hi>Bannes,</hi> another of the Supporters of your murdering principles, hath no other Apology to make for the <hi>Engliſh Papiſts,</hi> why they do not forcibly riſe up againſt a King and his Subjects pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſſing the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> but that they are not powerful enough for ſuch an Undertaking, and therefore the Attempt would be to their own prejudice and damage: So that ever ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation was bleſt with the enjoyment of your happy return to <hi>England,</hi> the whole <hi>Proteſtant Party</hi> only held their Lives at your Courteſie, and the Courteſie of your Cut-throat <hi>Papiſts,</hi> till you were in a condition by numbers and ſtrength to deſtroy and extirpate them. I cannot, by this time, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire your good-natur'd Bloodhounds, that did for ſeventeen Years together forbear to deſtroy us; it was becauſe that one of our Lives would have coſt three of yours. You may remember, Sir, that in the Year 1678, you had got at ſeveral times, from 1674 to that Year, about 20000 Men that were able to draw the Sword, of your own Religion, to reſide in and about <hi>London,</hi> who were under your pay, to riſe as ſoon as the word was given, which word was the Death of your Brother the King; they being Officer'd with your <hi>Popiſh</hi> Crew, were to have joyn'd with your Army, that was encamp'd at <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Crew, as our Friends in <hi>Ireland</hi> did in your Father's Reign. It is to be obſerv'd, that you wanting numbers at home, and knowing that 20000 men were not ſufficient to do the mighty Work upon your hands, which was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Hereticks, and the ruine of the <hi>Proteſtant Party,</hi> but wanting a back for your edge, you therefore applied your ſelf to <hi>France,</hi> for his Aid and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which you had obtain'd ſooner, had not that bloody Monſter been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a villanous War with his Neighbors; but as ſoon as he had made a peace with them, then you were reſolv'd upon the aforeſaid mighty Work, but by that time your Deſigns were diſcover'd, and the French King was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for that time to change his meaſures; and ſo were all the <hi>Popiſh Princes</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your villanous party of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> did at that time judge it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to draw in their Horns, and conceal theſe foregoing principles, or ſuffer them for a ſeaſon to lye dormant by them: Yet, to give you your due, you never ſuffer'd us to be any conſiderable time without ſome Teſtimony of your Good-will to us, to ſhew us how ready you and your Cut-throats were to do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This brings me to the villanous Practices of your Church and your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all Ages, which are living Teſtimonies againſt your villanous Crew to this day. I pray call to mind the vaſt numbers of Chriſtians that have been butcher'd by the <hi>Roman Inquiſition,</hi> of which it is reported that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth ſhould ſay, That <hi>the Authority of the See of</hi> Rome <hi>depended upon it,</hi> and that <hi>it was ſettled in</hi> Spain <hi>by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, not that which came down from Heaven, but that which was ſent to</hi> Rome <hi>in a Cloak-bag.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what infinite ſlaughters were committed upon the Servants of Chriſt, by the <hi>Cruſades</hi> and <hi>Holy Wars.</hi> Authentick Authors tell us, That in <hi>France</hi> alone Ten hundred thouſand Perſons were ſlain in the perſecution againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and upon no other occaſion, but their diſſenting from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> What think you of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre, by which in a few days there were murder'd above Forty thouſand perſons, for no other reaſon, but becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had adjudg'd 'em Hereticks?

It would not be amiſs for you to read at your leiſure the Chronicles of <hi>England,</hi> that teſtifie the ſame; the number of the Rebels may be judg'd by the account we have of thoſe that were ſlain, and thoſe that were taken Priſoners at ſome of the Defeats that were given unto them: Of thoſe that did riſe in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> about Five thouſand were ſlain and taken Priſoners; and in the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

about Five thouſand were ſlain that were in Rebellion in thoſe Counties, beſides thoſe who were taken Priſoners; and the Rebellion in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> in which many were deſtroy'd: After the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> mounted the Throne, tho' ſome ſay that ſhe was in her own nature merciful, yet her Religion obliged her to thoſe Cruelties, which left an indeleble ſtain upon her Memory: For her ſake, as well as for your own, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> endeavour'd to exclude you.

The Doctrines they publickly preach in their Churches, and teach in their Schools to their young Students to be educated under them, for it is as plain as the Sun at Noon day, that the Popes pretend to have a power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings, and that no King reigns, but at the pleaſure of the Pope. And from hence, Sir, give me leave to obſerve two things; 1. That by reaſon of the Doctrin they have taught, and do ſtill teach, they publiſh themſelves not only Rogues ready for any Deſign againſt the Peace and Safety of any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom where-ever they ſhall be admitted, but alſo publiſh themſelves Traytors of the deepeſt dye, and ought to have been proceeded againſt as ſuch, tho' never convicted of any Action ſuitable to ſuch Principles, for the Principle it ſelf is the higheſt Treaſon, that any foreign Power ſhould have power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Prince that owes him neither ſuit nor ſervice, tho' there be no Overt Act for the condemning ſuch Villains: And it is well known to your ſelf, that ſo far as the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> hath only an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Could any Government be ſecur'd of the Loyalty of ſuch a perſon, who taught ſuch pernicious Principles as theſe? No ſurely. I will give you a home Inſtance of this: There were ſome Iriſh Papiſts, ſince the Year 1660, had in a Remonſtrance prepar'd for the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Government, that they were perſons of great Loyalty, and owned King <hi>Charles</hi> their law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That Peace was much to be deſired between the French King, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that nothing could procure a good one for the French King, but the Diſſolution of the then Parliament, who tho' they had been laterally by you and your Rogues well bribed to give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an ill Vote; yet at laſt they began like Engliſh Men to fly in the Kings Face, and roar againſt Popery, eſpecially upon an empty Pocket; and if Fortune had not ſent them a ſeaſonable ſhower or two in a Seſſion, to cultivate their Inclinations to act according to the bent of the then Court; and till this peace was made between the French King and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, little could be done towards the revival of the Catholick Cauſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its recovering that fatal ſtroke by recalling the Liberty of Conſcience, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up that damnable Doctrine of a Proteſtant State Purgatory, which hindred many an honeſt Apoſtolical Cut-throat from having a Place at Court; but you will ſay, Why ſhould the Diſſolution of our Parliament procure a Peace?

This Letter your Cattle would have to be counterfeited by <hi>Coleman,</hi> but your Brother ſaw the Copy of the French King's Letter, and might have ſeen the Original, if he had been as honeſt as I was earneſt to have your Papers ſeiz'd, as well as <hi>Coleman</hi>'s: But that Letter was full of very gracious Expreſſions to you, and in it he blamed your Friends, for not having done the Great Work, which that King ſaid would embarraſs all your Affairs; and what that was, a Man might eaſily gueſs, for the Reaſon he gave was an explication of it, that there was not the leaſt Truſt to be put in him.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had King <hi>CHARLES</hi> read this Letter, but he was very much ſtartled.</p>
            <p>Now the deſtruction of the Prince of Orange was pointed at in plain words at length; and it's well known, that the French King then would not agree to the Summ of Three hundred Thouſand pounds for your Brother's Uſe, but for your own, and the Penſion of Three hundred Thouſand pounds per Annum was ſetled upon you.</p>
            <p>Now this Summ and this Penſion was not the Penſion that your Brother aimed at, for this was fixed three Years before that was ſought: And Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had his Twenty thouſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to ſecure his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty from any hazard, as to that point I propos'd his Majeſty ſhould offer that ſum upon that condition, and if the condition were not perfomed, the Money ſhould never be due; if it were, and that a Peace would certainly follow thereupon, (which no Body doubted) his Majeſty would gain his Ends, and ſave all the vaſt expences of the next Campaign, by which he could not hope to better his Condition, or put himſelf into more advantagious Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Treaty then he was then in; but might very probably be in a much worſe, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mighty oppoſition he was like to meet with, and the uncertain Chances of War. But admitting that his Majeſty could by his great ſtrength and Conduct maintain himſelf in as good a Condition to Treat the next year as he was then in, (which was as much as could then reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be hoped for,) be ſhould have ſaved by this Propoſal, as much as all the Men he must needs loſe, and all the charges he ſhould be at in a year, would be valued to amount to more than</hi> 300000 <hi>l.</hi> ſterl. <hi>and ſo much more in caſe his Condition ſhould decay, as it ſhould be worſe then it was when this vvas made; and the Condition of his</hi> R.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe Letters came to us about the middle of</hi> September <hi>and his</hi> R. H. <hi>expected daily when Monſieur</hi> Rouvigny <hi>ſhould ſpeak to him about the ſubject of that Letter; but he took no notice at all of any thing till the</hi> 29th, <hi>of</hi> September, <hi>the evening before the King and Duke went to</hi> Newmarket <hi>for afortnight, and then only ſaid, that he had Commands from his Maſter to give his</hi> R.

The Duke wondering at this proceeding, and being obliged to ſtay a good part of</hi> October <hi>at</hi> Newmarket; <hi>and ſoon after his coming back hearing of the Death of Father</hi> Ferryer, <hi>he gave over all further proſecuting of the former Projects. But I believe I ſaw Monſieur</hi> Rouvigny's <hi>policy all along, who was willing to ſave his Maſters Money, upon aſſurance that we would do all we could to ſtave off the Parliament for our own ſakes, that that we would ſtruggle as hard without money as with it; and we having by that time, upon our own Interest, prevailed to get the Parliament Prorogued to the</hi> 13th <hi>of</hi> April, <hi>he thought that Prorogation being to a day ſo high in the Spring, would put the Confederates ſo far beyond their Meaſures, as that it might procure a Peace, and be as uſeful to</hi> France, <hi>as a Diſſolution: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe Reaſons I ſuppoſe he went.

                     <hi>To this Purpoſe I preſs'd Mounſieur</hi> Pompone <hi>frequently by Sir</hi> William Throckmorton, <hi>who returned hence again into</hi> France <hi>on the</hi> 10th <hi>of</hi> November, <hi>the day our Parliament ſhould have met, but was Prorogued. Mounſieur</hi> Pompone <hi>(as I was informed by Sir</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am) <hi>did ſeem to approve the thing; but yet had Two Objections againſt it: First, That the Sum we propoſed, was Great; and cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d be very ill ſpared in the circumſtances his</hi> Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty <hi>was in. To which we Anſwered, That if by his Expending that Sum, he could procure a Diſſolution of our Parliament, and thereby a Peace, which every body agreed would neceſſarily follow,</hi> His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty <hi>would gain his Ends, and ſave Five or Ten times a greater Sum, and ſo be a good Husband by his Expence; and if we did not procure a Diſſolution, he ſhould not be at that Expence at all; for that we Deſired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>m only to promiſe upon that Condition, which we were content to be Obliged to perform firſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:95393:52"/>
                     <hi>The Second Objection was, The Duke did not move, nor appear in it Himſelf. To that we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he did not indeed to Mounſieur</hi> Pompone, <hi>becauſe he had found ſo ill an effect of the Negotiation with Father</hi> Ferryer, <hi>when it came into Mounſieur</hi> Rouvigny<hi>'s hands; but that he had concerned himſelf in it to Father</hi> Ferryer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet I continued to proſecute and preſs the Diſſolution of the Parliament, deteſting all Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as only ſo much loſs of time, and a means of ſtrengthning all thoſe who depend upon it in Oppoſition to the</hi> Crown, <hi>the Intereſt of</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> Catholic Religion, <hi>in the Opinion they had taken, That our King durſt not part with his Parliament; apprehending that another would be much Worſe. Second, That he could not live long without a Parliament, therefore they muſt ſuddenly Meet; and the longer he kept them Off, the greater his Neceſſity would grow: and conſequently their power to make him do what they liſted, would increaſe accordingly: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they could but maintain themſelves a while, the day would certainly come in a ſhort time, in which they ſhould be able to work their Wills. Such Diſcourſes as theſe kept the</hi> Confederates <hi>and our</hi> Male Contents <hi>in heart, and made them weather on the War in ſpight of all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations: Therefore I preſs'd (as I have ſaid) a Diſſolution until</hi> February <hi>last, when our</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances <hi>were ſo totally</hi> Changed, <hi>that we were forced to change our</hi> Councels <hi>too, and be as much for the Parliaments Sitting, as we were before againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our</hi> Change <hi>was thus; Before that time the Lord</hi> Arlington <hi>was the only Miniſter in Credit, who thought himſelf out of all danger of the Parliament; he having been Accuſed before them and Juſtified, and therefore was Zealous for their ſitting; and to increaſe his Reputation with them, and to become a perfect Favourite, he ſets himſelf all he could, to Perſecute the</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic <hi>Religion, and to oppoſe the</hi> French: <hi>To ſhew his Zeal againſt the firſt, he revived ſome old dormant Orders for prohibiting</hi> Roman Catholics <hi>to appear before the King, and put them in Execution at his firſt coming into his Office of Lord</hi> Chamberlain: <hi>And to make ſure work with the ſecond, as he thought; prevailed with the King to give him and the Earl of</hi> Oſſory, <hi>(who marryed two Siſters of</hi> Myne Heere Odyke<hi>'s) leave to go over into</hi> Holland <hi>with the ſaid</hi> Heere, <hi>to make a Viſit, as they pretended, to their Relations: But indeed, and in truth, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Lady</hi> Mary <hi>(Eldeſt Daughter of his R H.) as a Match for the Prince of</hi> Orange; <hi>not only without the conſent, but against the good Liking of his R. H.: in ſo much, that the Lord</hi> Arlingtons <hi>Creatures were forced to excuſe him, with a Diſtinction, that the ſaid Lady was not to be looked upon as the Dukes Daughter, but as the Kings, and a Child of the State was, and ſo the Duke's conſent not much to be Conſidered in the diſpoſal of her, but only the Intereſt of State. By this he intended to render himſelf the Darling of Parliament and Protestants, who look'd upon themſelves as ſecured in their Religion by ſuch an Alliance, and deſigned further to draw us into a Cloſe Conjunction with</hi> Holland, <hi>and the Enemies of</hi> France. <hi>The Lord</hi> Arlington <hi>ſet forth upon this Errand the</hi> Tenth <hi>of</hi> November, 1674. <hi>and returned not till the</hi> Sixth <hi>of January following; During his Abſence, the L.</hi> Treaſurer, <hi>L.</hi> Keeper, <hi>and the Duke of</hi> Lauderdale, <hi>who were the only</hi> Miniſters <hi>of any</hi> conſiderable Credit <hi>with the</hi> King, <hi>and who all pretended to be entirely <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to the Duke, declaimed Loundly; and with great Violence; againſt the ſaid Lord, and his Actions in</hi> Holland; <hi>and did hope, in his abſence, to have totally Supplanted him, and to have routed him out of the Kings Favour; and after that, thought they might eaſily enough have dealt with the Parliament. But none of them had Courage enough to ſpeak againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, till they could get rid of him; for fear they ſhould not ſucceed, and that the Parliament would Sit in ſpight of them, and come to hear that they had uſed their endeavours againſt it: which would have been ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npardonable a Crime with our</hi> Omniporent Parliament <hi>that no Power could have been able to have Saved them from</hi> Puniſhment: <hi>But they finding at his Return, that</hi>

                     <hi>they could not prevail againſt him, by ſuch Means and Arts as they had then tryed, reſolved upon</hi> New Councels; <hi>which were to out-run him in his own Courſe; which accordingly they under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>In order to this, we have two great Deſigns to Attempt this next Seſſions.</hi> Firſt, <hi>that which we were about before,</hi> viz. <hi>To put the Parliament upon making it their humble Request to the King, that the Fleet may be put into his</hi> R.

If we carry theſe two, or either of them, we ſhall in effect do what we liſt afterwards; and truly, we think we do not undertake theſe great points very unreaſonably, but that we have good Cards for our Game; Not but that we expect great Oppoſition, and have great Reaſon to beg all the Aſſistance we can poſſibly get, and therefore, if his</hi> Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty <hi>would stand by us a little in this</hi> Conjuncture <hi>and help us with ſuch a ſum as</hi> 20000. <hi>l.</hi> ſterling <hi>(which is no very great matter to venture upon ſuch an undertaking as this) I would be content to be Sacrificed to the utmoſt Malice of my Enemies, if I did not Succeed. I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed This ſeveral times to Mounſieur</hi> Rouvigny, <hi>who ſeemed always of my Opinion; and has often told me, that he has Writ into</hi> France <hi>upon this Subject, and has deſired me to do the like: But I know not whether he will be as Zealous in that point as a</hi> Catholick <hi>would be; becauſe our prevailing in theſe things would give the greateſt Blow to the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>here, that ever it received ſince its Birth; which perhaps he would not be very glad to ſee; eſpecially when he believes there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of doing his Maſters Buſineſs well enough without it; which is by a</hi> Diſſolution <hi>of the Parliament; upon which I know he mightily depends, and Concludes, that if that comes to be</hi> Diſſolved, <hi>it will be as much as he needs care for; proceeding perhaps upon the ſame manner of Diſcourſe which we had this time twelve months. But with ſubmiſſion to his better Judgment, I do think that our Caſe is extreamly much altered to what it was, in Relation to a</hi> Diſſolution; <hi>for then the Body of our Governing Miniſters (all but the Earl of</hi> Arlington) <hi>were entirely united to the</hi> Duke; <hi>and would have Governed his Way, if they had been free from all Fear and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, as they had been, if the Parliament had been Removed.

            <p>But Sir, It is worthy of your Conſideration, and therefore I pray obſerve this, That this poor Gentleman being found in this Condition, the thinking ſort of Mankind were all much Concerned, and Multitudes went to ſee the dead Body, but your Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains with a wide Mouth gave out, that he was a melancholly Man, and that it was incident to his Family to make away with themſelves, but the Gentleman's Brother and Friends, knew the falſity of that Story and diſproved it, and were reſolved to look narrowly into the thing; and accordingly took ſo much Pains to have the Truth found out, that you were much offended at it, yet for all that, they let his Body lye Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ſeveral days; when his Body was found, you had a good Natur'd Villain that ſent for One of Sir <hi>Edmunds</hi> Brothers, and ſpoke with him concerning his Brothers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi> came, tho full of Confuſion and Trouble, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

would be ſo much a Friend to his Relations, as to endeavour to ſave his Eſtate, and find a way to Prevail upon the Coroner to return him Diſtracted, that the Eſtate might not be forfieted to the King, or he would beg the Eſtate of the King for him, and his Relations; this was the Sum and Subſtance of the Rogues diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> but Sir, you may Remember that this Villain had agreed with you, that Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Legg</hi> ſhould beg the Eſtate, and accordingly did beg the Eſtate of the King your Brother, and the Eſtate was given to the ſaid <hi>Legg,</hi> upon Condition the Coroners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt returned Juſtice <hi>Godfrey</hi> a <hi>Pelo de ſe,</hi> and that was the Game you played to the utmoſt of your Power, ſo that as you and your Villains had robbed him of his Life, his Eſtate alſo muſt go to maintain the Luxury of One of your Minions.</p>
            <p>Well then, how did Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi> Carry himſelf in this Affair? Truly he was much Concerned at this white-liver'd Devil, and his diabolical Suggeſtions, and honeſtly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the Offers made him by this filthy Suborner. Nay, if the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> himſelf had been in his Place, he could not have ſhewed a greater Abhorrence of this Devil incarnate, and therefore more fully he was reſolved to purſue his Point, and did with the utmoſt Vigor, and you was graciouſly pleaſed all this time not to be Idle, and you had good reaſon Honeſt Man, therefore you joyned in with Mrs. <hi>Remarkable</hi> his Spouſe, and abroad you ſend your Rogues who were extreamly buſie with the Coroner and Jury, whom you could Bribe, as well as your white-liver'd Spark could Suborn, and between the one and the other, you gave your ſelves great hopes of a return of a <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and were mighty Merry at the Chopps, as if Gallows Wood had been all your own, but the Coroner and his Jury finding his Neck broke, and the Shoes on his Feet clean, with other apparent Proofs, which were ſo Manifeſt that all the Tricks you and your Villains had uſed to ſmother this Murther, were to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the Jury brought it in a Barbarous Murther, and ſo <hi>Legg</hi> went without the Eſtate, and you were defeated of your Expectations, he was ſolemnly buried, and all Mankind but the Conſpirators believed that he was Murthered by the Papiſts, and the Councel Iſſued out a Proclamation to Diſcover the Murderers.</p>
            <p>But how do you Strut and Vapour like a Pig in a Sty, that hath had two breakfaſts in a Morning, and ſay I, how doth it appear that the Papiſts Murdered Sir <hi>Edmund Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Godfrey?</hi> And how doth it appear that I was Concerned in it?

Juſtice <hi>Godfrey,</hi> who that he was a Proteſtant no Man gave greater Demonſtrations than himſelf, ſo that he was far enough from being Inrolled in the number of the Friends of your Villainous Crew: I muſt needs ſay of that poor Gentleman, That he little thought that a profeſſed Member of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> and a bold Aſſertor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine, and a conſtant Reliever of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, not only ſo, but One that Expected to be the firſt Martyr under the Popiſh Rage, ſhould be to Poſterity marked as a Cordial Friend to thoſe avowed Enemies of his own Religion, what Impudence<hi>!</hi> Had your Rogues to call him a principal Confident of your Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Crew, that were Enemies to our Laws and Liberties for the Preſervation of which, he was a watchful Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Sir to be Plain with you, what Truth, or what thing like Truth, could we Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you, or your Villains, who after you had Murdered in a moſt barbarous Manner an Innocent Gentleman, you were not Contented with that, but by a ſecond Aſſaſſination, you did Endeavour to Murder him in his Credit and Reputation, I cannot forbear to admire the Wiſdom of our good God to the Nation, that gave you and your wicked wretched Party up to vent your Lies that were ſo Palpable, that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Party of Mankind might the better be prepared and fortified againſt thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reports, which then your Devils, ſuch Liars in one thing, they were not by them to be Credited in any other thing, unleſs they brought better Proof then their bare Teſtimony, now Sir, I will Anſwer you two Queſtions, that you juſt now Huffed and Bounced withal.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How it did Appear that <hi>Godfrey</hi> was Murthered by the Papiſts, you cannot have Forgotten that he was a very Uſeful and an Active Juſtice of the Peace, and that he had taken more Examinations of the Popiſh Plot, than you were willing the World ſhould be bleſt withal, and was very Diligent in finding out thoſe who had been Active in this Plot of yours, and from the Sixth of <hi>September</hi> to the day of his Death, he had employed much of his Time in ſerving the Public in Relation to that Conſpiracy, ſome of the Prieſts and Jeſuits and eke your ſweet ſelf foreſeeing your own Danger, and the overthrow of your bleſſed Deſign, you and they had been Carrying on for ſo many Years, your Councel at St. <hi>Jameſes</hi> had ſeveral Conſultations with you, how to prevent the Diſcovery, and as you and your Party did never uſe to ſtick at Blood, but rather counted it Meritorious to ſhed it, though never ſo unjuſtly, when your Cauſe and Church might be Profited by it, you did reſolve to ſecure your Self and Party, by the taking away his Life, and in order to this your Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits, and others had ſeveral meetings, where they debated the neceſſity of taking away the Life of this worthy Gentleman; therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me obſerve to you what Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> told me, and to introduce that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, you may remember, that upon the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1678, I did go before Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey,</hi> and there upon Oath, I gave in ſeveral Depoſitions, after that the ſaid <hi>Godfrey</hi> had ſworn me upon them, he delivered them again to me, and after that I had taken two or three Copies of thoſe Depoſitions, I went on the <hi>28th.</hi> of the ſame Month again to Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi> and Sir the <hi>28th,</hi> at Night all thoſe Depoſitions were laid open, and made out before the then Councel, and I was Examined by the King your Brother the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and upon <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> he told me, that ſeveral Perſons of Quality had Threatned him for being ſo Zealous in the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and alſo told me, that others who were well wiſhers to the Diſcovery, did

think he had not been quick enough but too Remiſs, and that they would Complain of him in Parliament, which was to ſit the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following, at which he was much concerned, but I told him that I knew how diligent he had been, and that he need not fear a Parliament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and the Week before he was miſſing he came to me, and told me that the day before you went to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> that you had ſeverely Threatned him, and ſeveral others, ſome of whom were ſhut up in the <hi>Tower</hi> (for that Grace in your Church, which we call high Treaſon in ours,) and asked him what he had to do with it? In a Word, he told me that he went in Fear of his Life, by the whole Popiſh Party, and that he had been Dog'd ſeveral days, upon which I Adviſed him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. I pray call to mind the Evidence that Sir <hi>Thomas Robinſon</hi> cheif Prothonotary of the Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> gave who had been Acquainted with Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey</hi> above Forty Years, and was with him brought up a <hi>Westminster</hi> School, and continued in his Acquaintance all along till the breaking out of the Civil Wars, and after the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration their Acquaintance was again renewed, and were for many Years in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Peace together, both for the City of <hi>Westminſter</hi> and County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> theſe two Gentlemen met upon the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> which was upon a <hi>Munday,</hi> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the head Baily, it being the Quarter Seſſions for <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> and this Sir <hi>Thomas Robinſon</hi> had ſome Diſcourſe of your Popiſh Plot, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> told Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> that he underſtood that he (Sir <hi>Edmund)</hi> had taken ſeveral Examinations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Popiſh Plot, to which Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> Anſwered, that he had, but thought he ſhould have little Thanks for his Pains, and further told the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> that what he did, was not with that forwardneſs which was generally thought, being more willing that any body elſe would have done it rather than he, but Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> told him, he had done no more than his duty, and was very Curious with Sir <hi>Edmunds</hi> leave to have ſeen the Examinations, but at that time you, or your whiteliver'd Tode had them in keeping, and ſo he could not pleaſure his old Friend but Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did teſtifie his Zeal for having the bottom of the Plot Diſcovered: Truly Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> was much Affraid, for his Friend always ſaid, That he ſhould be the firſt Martyr, he being asked whether he was Affraid of himſelf, he ſaid no, he did not Fear them if they came fairly, for that he ſhould part not with his Life tam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Mr. <hi>Chetwin,</hi> who will tell you, that he was for the moſt part of the Summer, 1678, in the Countrey, and about the <hi>29th,</hi> of <hi>August</hi> came into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> at that time a Gentleman one Mr. <hi>Sanbidge</hi> who was a Kinſman of the Lord <hi>Aſtons,</hi> and well accquainted with the Family where he then was as a gueſt, which was half a Mile diſtant from the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſtons,</hi> uſed to come and play at Tables with Mr. <hi>Chetwin,</hi> at one particular time in <hi>October</hi> the ſaid <hi>Sanbidge</hi> came and told him, that a Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was Killed, to

which Mr <hi>Chetwin</hi> did ſay, that he had received Letters from thence the very laſt Poſt, which gave him no account of it, then he told him that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had reported it: Now Sir I pray Obſerve on Saturday your Villains did murder him, that very night they gave notice to their friends, he was miſſed the <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Munday,</hi> and we knew not what was become of him till <hi>Thurſday,</hi> now this <hi>Tueſday</hi> was the <hi>Tueſday</hi> after the <hi>Saturday,</hi> on which he was Murthered; ſo that it was plain to all the world that you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. The Fourth Witneſs that I ſhall put you in mind of was Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who ſaid the ſame thing that Mr. <hi>Chetwin</hi> had before reſtified, concerning the news of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Bury Godfreys</hi> Murther, he received a Letter from your old Friend <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who gave his Brother <hi>Ewers</hi> this Account in theſe words, this night Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey</hi> is diſpatched, which when <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaw he was much diſcontented and ſaid, this would ſpoil all the buſineſs, and upon the <hi>Tueſday</hi> he went to an Alehouſe that was near his Lords Houſe, and reported the ſame, by which means Mr. <hi>Chetwin</hi> came to have the news of the Murther of <hi>Godfrey</hi> on the <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and we in <hi>London</hi> knew not what became of him till the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, but you took all the Care you could that as little Teſtimony as might be ſhould be produced at the tryal of the Murtherers, for <hi>Dugdale</hi> was omitted and his Teſtimony of that Murther lay dorment till the Tryal of the five Jeſuits.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Fifth Witneſs that I ſhall produce in the point under Conſideration is Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> he was your <hi>Demetrius</hi> that made your Silver Shrines for the Houſe of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the Braſs Screws and Antependiums that he fitted up for the Service of <hi>Baal,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him a man much noted amongſt your Villainous Crew, but before I tell you what he ſpake to this matter, give me leave Sir, to Relate one Story of Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfreys</hi> Murther which I never ſaw but once in Print, and I rather inſert this Story, becauſe that firſt-born of Impudence and Falſeneſs, <hi>Leſtrange</hi> ſo ridiculed <hi>Prance</hi> his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, becauſe he recanted in your Brothers <hi>Cloſet,</hi> all that he had been Examined and Sworn to about the Death of Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey,</hi> which he again Recanted after he came to Priſon, you Remember he was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and was a <hi>Silver-Smith,</hi> and uſed to make <hi>Trinkets</hi> for the <hi>Prieſts</hi> about Town, and was aſſiſting at that Murther, ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I pray Sir, how do you? And how do you like your ſelf by this time? how will you come of? Therefore to conclude all, Is there not here a monſtrous Evidence of your whole <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot?

            <p>Truly Sir, I did never hear, that any Objection was made to the Teſtimony of this Man, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> is yet alive, and can give a better Account of him than I can do at preſent, but this I will ſay for him, (if I am not much out) that he gave the then Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> ſuch a warming bout, for treating him courſly for leaving the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I thought the old Villain of a Prieſt in ſome danger of being beaten, but had I known what villainous <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principles that baſe Fellow held, I ſhould never have appeared for him in the caſe of <hi>Sedway,</hi> but I confeſs then, that <hi>Gastrel</hi> told me, that <hi>Gunning</hi> was a Man of very rotten Principles in relation to our Reforming from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but he was your Favourite, dear Sir, and that was enough to have publiſhed him a well-wiſher to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Mathematicks, once he told me, that he thought the Church of God had no loſs by the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; but this by the way, I haſten to a ſecond Witneſs.</p>

in the caſe, for by the means of this Villain <hi>Spalding</hi> your Sir <hi>Politick Fringe</hi> (that grins upon a Mans Face though he be reſolved that moment to cut his Throat) had a Character of every Gentleman in and about <hi>Wales,</hi> being much aſſiſted in that bleſſed Work by one <hi>Herbert,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, another true blew Proteſtant, one of Sir <hi>Politick</hi>'s Agents; this Sir, was your <hi>Spalding,</hi> a Spy for you upon many Families, in order if poſſible to their ruin, by your means this <hi>Spalding</hi> got his Inlargement, and was taken care of by you as a main Prop of your Cauſe and Conſpiracy in the <hi>Welſh</hi> Counties, but Sir, why ſhould I wonder at theſe Practiſes of yours, and of your good Sir <hi>Politick,</hi> ſince both of you have been taught, and do ſtill believe, that it is but a Deed of Charity to ruine any Man that ſtands in either of your ways, the Doctrine you have been taught will induce any thinking Man to believe your Practice; and both your Practiſes, and his, do ſufficiently prove the Damnableneſs of the Doctrin you have received.</p>

            <p>Upon which the Lords Ordered to ſearch the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Houſe, and to ſeize all dangerous Papers and Perſons, but notice being given to the Conſpirators, the Prieſts and Papers were conveyed to St. <hi>Jameſes,</hi> to be graciouſly diſpoſed of as you ſhould think fit, and when the Lords had notice of it, there could be nothing further done in the Affair, becauſe your Brother the King (to give the Rogues a Taſte of his Royal Favour) raiſed the Parliament, and ſent them home, when they were in the midſt of their Work in Diſcovering the horrid Villanies of your ſelf and Party.</p>

                  <hi>IN the Month of</hi> Auguſt 1678, <hi>I having occaſion to write to a Friend in the Country, but could not tell well how to ſend, I went to Mr.</hi> Paſtons, <hi>who lodged at one</hi> Bambers <hi>a</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>in</hi> Duke-ſtreet, <hi>who gave me an Account where to ſend to him and we immediately fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diſcourſe concerning the preſent poſture of Affairs, and he bid me not to fear, for we ſhould ſuddenly have better times; for in the firſt place, he ſaid, that the King was a great Heretick and that the Lord</hi> Bellaſis, <hi>and Lord</hi> Arundel, <hi>and Lord</hi> Powis, <hi>and the Lord</hi> Petre <hi>would have a very good Army for the Depoſing of the King, and the ſuppreſſion of the Hereticks, and then the</hi> Catholick <hi>Religion ſhould be eſtabliſhed, and flouriſh in this Nation, he alſo ſaid, that the above named Lords had given out Commiſſions already to ſome Gentlemen in the Country, whom he named to me; who were Mr.</hi> Talbot <hi>of</hi> Longford, <hi>and Sir</hi> Henry Beddingfield <hi>of</hi> Oxborow Hall <hi>in</hi> Norfolk, <hi>and one Mr.</hi> Stone, <hi>who lives within four or five miles of</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton <hi>upon</hi> Thames<hi>: Alſo about two years ago one</hi> Townley <hi>of</hi> Townley <hi>in</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>came up to</hi> London <hi>with his two Sons, whom he was carrying over to</hi> Doway, <hi>he alſo brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him his two Brothers to keep him Company, they took Lodgings at</hi> Ayries <hi>houſe in</hi> Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Lane, <hi>where</hi> Fenwick <hi>lodged, and in a ſhort time two of them went over to</hi> Doway <hi>with the two Lads, and left the other here, who in the abſence of his Brothers declared very often to my Wifes Brother, and to</hi> Adamſon, <hi>that when his Brothers came back again from</hi> Doway, <hi>they expected Commiſſions from the above named Lords for the raiſing of Men for the Carrying on the</hi> Catholick <hi>Cauſe, this my Brother and</hi> Adamſon <hi>often told me at</hi> Pettleyes <hi>in</hi> Veres-ſtreet, <hi>where we had a Club very often of none but</hi> Papiſts.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now Sir, we have given you an account of what Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſwore before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament concerning the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> in which you may ſee your ſelf engaged; for you had a buſineſs upon your hands, and that buſineſs was to be followed cloſely, and then the Catholick Religion would flouriſh, and you know to what a degree of Zeal and Piety you were converted, as not to regard any thing in the world in compariſon of God Almighty's Glory, and the Salvation of your own, and the converſion of this poor Kingdom, which hath been a long time oppreſſed, and miſerably haraſſed with Hereſie and Schiſm; nay, your Zeal was ſuch, That <hi>Coleman</hi> could ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf awake, when he thought on it, I will now put you in mind of what he diſcovered upon Oath concerning the ſaid <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> at the Tryals of ſeveral of your
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95393:64"/>
Villains; I begin with the Tryals of the five <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Prance</hi> did with all chearfulneſs declare, That <hi>Harcourt</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and one of your Councellors at St. <hi>Jameſes</hi> told <hi>Prance,</hi> that there was a deſign of killing the King, and St. <hi>Ireland, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> who was one of your <hi>Popiſh</hi> Meſſengers, and <hi>Firers</hi> of the Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> told him of 50000 Men, that were to be raiſed for the carrying on of the <hi>Catholick Cauſe,</hi> and to ſettle the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, which Affair was to be managed by the <hi>Five Lords,</hi> that were for that Conſpiracy committed to the Tower, who as well as <hi>Whitebread</hi> were to grant Commiſſions for Officers, nay, had actually granted ſeveral, and to incourage this <hi>Prance</hi> (who though he had but a little Senſe, yet he had ſo much as to dread a Civil War) told him, that he need not fear he ſhould have Church Work enough.</p>
            <p>It will not be unneceſſary to make ſome Obſervations upon Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, before we come to another, and in it here are five or ſix things worthy of your Conſideration; 1. Here is expreſly ſworn, That Popery was to be introduced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which you know is High Treaſon, your Prieſts all expected to ſee the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that then all things would do well, and your Prieſts ſhould have fat Parſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and then all things would go right. 2. This Religion was to be brought in by an Army, you know, that your Dragooning Apoſtles here might have planted Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in as an effectual way as they ruin'd the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> 3. Here is the King your Brother declared an Heretick, and therefore by your <hi>Popiſh</hi> Army to be depoſed, and by <hi>Meſſenger</hi> to be deſtroyed. 4. Here is your ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here is all the Incouragement in the World to prevent them from fainting in the Cauſe for fear of a Civil War, they ſhould have Trade enough, what can be plainer, let all the World judge.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="1">1. That in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678, when the King your Brother was at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> going to <hi>Windſor</hi> on the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and returning the <hi>19th,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon his return, that night he went to give Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> a Viſit, and found him at the Sign of the Hart in <hi>Ruſſel street</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and after a Salute Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> asked him many queſtions, as what News from <hi>Windſor?</hi> How the King ſpent his time? what Recreation he followed? and whether he walked abroad much? and how guarded? To which Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> anſwered, that the King delighted much in Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fiſhing, but moſt in the latter, which he followed early in the Morning with ſome few Perſons attending him; upon which Mr <hi>Ireland</hi> replyed, that he wondred, that the King was no better guarded, he was eaſily to be taken off, whereupon Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> replyed, and ſaid, God forbid, which made <hi>Ireland</hi> ſtop his Diſcourſe, Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting this to Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Aſh,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spicer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> replyed, he was the night before this Diſcourſe in Company with Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son to the then Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> where he heard them diſcourſe this matter, Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> ſaying, that he heard Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> ſpeak the ſame things, whereupon Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> undertook to go that very day to <hi>Hampſtead</hi> to Sir <hi>Michael Wharton,</hi> and give Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> an Account of it the next Morning, and Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spicer</hi> alſo before Mr. <hi>Chetwind,</hi> and they parted having promiſed to go to Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> they met him, who ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified every Syllable of what he ſaid, and withal remembred very well, that when Sir <hi>Michael</hi> took ſome particular notice of it, Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> ſeemed to be ſurpriſed, and was ſorry he had uttered thoſe words, but Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> who was preſent, ſaid, <hi>Jeniſon</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retract your words, for I have a Letter under your hand, which will put you in mind of the time, and he ſaid Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> repeated the very ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1679, Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> met with Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> and diſcourſed the Matter with him, who then owned all the queſtions that <hi>Ireland</hi> asked him; namely, what News at <hi>Windſor?</hi> and how the King ſpent his time? but Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> deſired a days time to conſider, that he might be exact as to the time when they were ſpoken; for that ſeveral had told him, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> had been in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> from the <hi>fifth</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and therefore he reſolved to be ſerious in thinking upon the time, when he had this Diſcou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the ſaid <hi>VVilliam Ireland</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the ſaid four Perſons named as aforeſaid by this Informant, as fit for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and declared that he knew Mr. <hi>Levallyn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kerney</hi> before this Informant had named them, by which this Informant did apprehend, that he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with them of the ſaid Deſign for <hi>VVindſor</hi> before the nomination aforeſaid.

            <p>From which Informations and the foregoing Account of Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> coming in, there are theſe particulars worthy of your Obſervation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a remarkable inſtance of Divine Providence, that this latent Evidence accidentally diſcovered to Mr. <hi>Chetwind,</hi> ſhould be thus recovered by him, and that in his purſuit thereof ſo many worthy Perſons likewiſe unknown to him as alſo Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> ſhould accidentally occur to him and Contribute their Aſſiſtance, but this Obſervation may be of little uſe to you, becauſe you and your Prieſts know little of that Doctrine of Divine Providence.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> at the writing of the aforeſaid Letter to Mr. <hi>Bowes,</hi> was of your own Sinagogue, and in Obedience to the Kings <hi>Proclamation</hi> for Baniſhing <hi>Papiſts</hi> out of <hi>London,</hi> he retired from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Reading,</hi> ſo that the Diſcovery made by his Letter, could not rationally be imputed to any other inducement or incitement, ſave only the power of Truth, eſpecially Conſidering Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was nearly related to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The whole Popiſh Plot is evidently Confirmed, not only by the Papiſts expecting ſome great Change and Alteration mentioned in one of the Informations by him gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but alſo of the four <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ruſſians, and that which related to Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> in another, but alſo by thoſe ſuſpicious Queſtions propoſed by the ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> to Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> upon his return from <hi>Windſor</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> what News from <hi>Windſor?</hi> How is the King guarded? And eſpecially by thoſe dangerous Words, then he may be eaſily taken off, or to that effect, which do ſufficiently Argue, and not only ſo, but manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, his not only being privy to the Plot, but alſo of being an Hell-born inſtrument therein.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> Informations, are here Exhibited to you in Parcels, partly for the relief of his Memory, and partly becauſe his Conſent to theſe Matters being not Voluntary, but in a ſort Conſtrained, he was the leſs concerned to charge his Memory, ſo as to obſerve any Method in giving the ſame, whereas if he had been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver in this Deſign of yours, he would have obſerved a better Method without the leaſt interruption, and therefore Sir, I muſt conclude that theſe frequent Fractures, which Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> made, did ſufficiently Argue, that he was not One of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel at St. <hi>Jameſes,</hi> no not ſo much as a <hi>Wildhouſe</hi> Engineer in this Matter, therefore when it was diſcovered to him, his concealing the Treaſon was rather his Guilt than his Activity in the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And a <hi>Second</hi> thing is to be obſerved, that he had reaſon to diſcover, for there was a thing called <hi>Self Preſervation,</hi> which was a prevailing argument with him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the caſe of the four Ruſſians, for a Gentleman of his Acquaintance informed him the very next day after the Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> that one of thoſe four Ruffians was come into the Committe of the then Councel, and had confeſſed his Guilt, and upon hopes of Pardon, had offered to Diſcover his Accomplices, this wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> becauſe he was conſcious to himſelf, that he had nominated thoſe four Rogues to Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> and conſidering that his diſcovery (if made) would reflect upon him, and therefore he thought it beſt to Conſult his own Safety, and to Anticipate the diſcovery of this Ruſſian, of which <hi>Jeniſon</hi> was affraid by making his own; this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is not much for Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> Credi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, in relation to his Merit, for it ſavours much
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95393:70"/>
of his human Frailty, and Timidity, and therefore it did take off much from the Honour of this Service that he then undertook, yet behold the integrity of this poor Gentleman, that choſe rather to expoſe his own Infirmity, than to Conceal any part of the Truth, to which he was by <hi>Ireland</hi> made privy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You may obſerve (if you think fit) that notwithſtanding the Importunities of his Brother, Aunt, and Couſin, when he was ſenſible of what great Obligation there lay upon him to his King and Country, his reſolution was not a whit abated, he had baſe Relations that did then purſue to ruine him, and indeed did at laſt accompliſh it, ſo that the poor Gentleman is reduced to extream want, which is a ſtrang reward for a Man that had faithfully ſerved his Countrey, as Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> did in this Point, and truly Sir, he ſtands much Obliged to you and your damnable Crew for it; I truſt the Government that now is, will caſt a favourable Eye upon that wretched Perſon, and not let him periſh for want of Bread.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You may Obſerve the particularity of that Diſcourſe, that paſſed between Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> upon the <hi>19th,</hi> which ſhews to the World what a caſe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Villain <hi>Ireland</hi> was, when he at the Gallows was pleaſed to ſay, That he returned not from <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> till the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and that he was out of Town the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but the Evidence not only of Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> ſhewed the Nature of the Man, but the poor Wench <hi>Sarah Paine,</hi> made it out by a better Circumſtance, by which <hi>Scroggs</hi> himſelf was ſatisfied that <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town, for the ſaid <hi>Paine</hi> ſwore ſhe went to live at the Lord <hi>Arlingtons</hi> on the week after the King went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and ſhe ſaw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> the week before ſhe went to the Lord <hi>Arlingtons,</hi> for which piece of Service your Brother and you forbid the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> to retain the ſaid <hi>Sarah Paine</hi> in his Service, and therefore the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> turned her out of doors to Starve, if it had been in his power, that this <hi>Sarah Paine</hi> knew <hi>Ireland</hi> is notorious, for ſhe was Servant to <hi>John Grove</hi> one of your Fire Merchants, and uſed to carry Letters to Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> that were directed for him, to her aforeſaid Maſter <hi>John Grove</hi> that was Hanged with <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. You may ſee the Zeal you and your Party had for the Propagation of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, you cared not what you did to advance Holy Church, 'tis true you were ſtrangly converted; and therefore no wonder if you did not make it your buſineſs to Ruine all that ſtood in your way: So Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi>'s Zeal to have the World to beware of your Zeal was as great, and durſt never to flinch from his Cauſe, though you made him to fly his Country, and engaged his Father to diſinherit him of his Birth-right, and to give it to a Son that yet remains a Member of your curſed Synagogue, but as for Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> here concerned in this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, he is ſtill alive to make good what he hath ſaid, and I am ſure he is of Age to ſpeak for himſelf, and can tell how he hath been treated by your Party for this his Zeal.</p>
            <p n="6">6. His Brother Mr. <hi>Thomas Jeniſons</hi> activity in theſe Affairs, is alſo worthy of your Remembrance, and Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> impartiality was ſuch, that he would not ſpare him, though he had a tenderneſs for him, as he was his Brother, which made him delay the Diſcovery of them, yet he did at laſt Diſcover them, though to the expoſing of his Brother, he was willing to ſave his own Brother, yet he was unwilling to endanger the Government, but at laſt you ſee he came to a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95393:70"/>
Reſolution, notwithſtanding the many Fluctuations of his Mind, of ſhewing himſelf a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, and he appeared, and gave the aforeſaid Teſtimony, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> any thing be to be objected againſt it, I ſuppoſe you have Rogues enough ready, but let them be great or little Rogues, let them come forth, and they ſhall be heard; but in the mean time, I pray Sir how like you all this, is it not Plain that you had a deſign to levy War upon the People, for <hi>Jeniſon</hi> was to have a Popiſh Commiſſion from you by the means of his Brother the Juſuit, but of this in its proper place.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I come to a <hi>Fifth</hi> Witneſs, and that was Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who fully declared the great Deſign that your Father <hi>Whitebread</hi> had, of deſtroying the King your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was one that was engaged in your mighty work, and by this <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> was <hi>Dugdale</hi> imployed to chooſe out Luſty and Couragious Men for the Work, the mighty Work, that you all had of killing the King, they were to be hardy and deſperate, as befitting their Apoſtolical power, by which the Nation was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, nay rather then fail, there was to be a Maſacre to root out the Proteſtant Religion, and truly Sir, you were much in the right, for it would have been a thing impoſſible to have rooted out the Proteſtant Religion, without deſtroying the Proteſtants, this was the uſe you were to make of your Hardy, Stout and Deſperate Apoſtles, which <hi>Dugdale</hi> was to find out, and it ſeems thoſe who could not Convert the Nation by their handy Labour, they were to Exerciſe their Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, therefore you had a ſet of Tongue Padds to ſtir up your Popiſh Party to be active in this glorious Deſign of yours, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was not only engaged by your wicked Jeſuites to deſtroy the King, but he was alſo intruſted with their Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Correſpondences both Forreign and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. The Impudence of your Apoſtolical Men, who were to Aſſiſt you in your mighty Work that you had upon your hands, that in their Common Poſt-letters, they ſhould write in Words at Length, that the King was to be deſtroyed, but Sir, the <hi>Poſt Office</hi> was yours, and ſo they might be the more bold, and you in the Deſign, and who was it at that time durſt open their Letters, who were Men of ſuch Value with you, that on them the hopes of <hi>England</hi> did depend, but your Villains made ſtrang of it, but it was not more Strang then True, for they had as good a Salvo for that, as they had for the Fire of <hi>London, viz.</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hrow it upon the Proteſtants, which brings me to a <hi>ſecond</hi> particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it was impoſſible for you and your villainous Party to do any thing towards the Advancement of your Cauſe without Murder, your Church is founded upon Blood, and therefore your deſign was written in Characters of Blood, ſo plain that any Man might run and read them, this was the way that you were to ſubdue the <hi>Northren</hi> Hereſie, that had ſo long domineered in this Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who replied Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>ſaid, ſhe was well, and that he had been with her in</hi> Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire <hi>at that time. This Informant, then asked him what a kind of man Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>was? Who anſwered that he was a fine Countenanced ſmiling man, and Swore if he be Guilty of this Plot, I will never truſt a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling man again; thereupon this Informant asked him what he thought of him? Who anſwered I doubt there is ſome Guilt in him, becauſe he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him when he came from</hi> Windſor, <hi>how the King diverted, and how he was attended, whereunto he anſwered in Hawking and Fiſhing, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only with three or four Perſons, Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>replied he would go ſo ſlenderly guarded, he were eaſily taken off, and then he pauſed, but ſometime after Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>repeated that he feared there was ſomething in that Plot, for that Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>had ſaid to him at another time, That there was but One in the way, and were he removed, the</hi> Catholic <hi>Religion might flouriſh again in</hi> England, <hi>whereupon this Informant ſaid, thoſe were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſuſpicious things which Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>had ſpoken about the King, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon old Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>roſe up and ſwore Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>was a Rogue, and ſo left the Room, and determined the diſcourſe at that time, but ſometime</hi>

This Informant anſwered yes, they have often practiſed it in this and other Kingdoms, and thereby brought more Schiſm and Diviſion into the Church than ever was, before ſuch damnable things were practiſed by the Pope and his Emiſſaries, whereto Mr.</hi> Jeniſon, <hi>replied you Seculars are generally againſt the Juſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, and in many things against the Pope, whereunto this Informant replied, if you pleaſe to conſider the Frauds and Deviliſh Artifices the Jeſuits uſe in their practice and teaching their Politic Intereſt, and induſtrious Self-ſeeking, all under the Hypocritical Zeal, and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Religious, though none ſo Irreligious, you would not wonder why all ſecular Priests are againſt them, and the Pope for upholding them, and their Practices and Principles: Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>replied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he believed they were crafty Men, upon which this Informant asked him, how he came now to ſay they were crafty Men, having formerly ſpoke ſo much of their Sanctity? He replied, becauſe he had conſidered ſeveral odd and ſuſpicious Expreſſions Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>had ſpoken to him; whereupon this Informant replied, you will only give the King and Country Satisfaction in declaring the odd and ſuſpicious Expreſſions of Mr.</hi> Ireland, <hi>who is now impriſoned for the Plot, but alſo diſcharge the Duty of a Chriſtian and Obligation of a Subject, urging many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons to perſwade Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>to make a full diſcovery to the Councel, whereunto Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>replied, he doubted the Jeſuits would prove as black as their Habits, adding that his Brother Mr.</hi> Thomas Jeniſon <hi>the Jeſuit, told him, there was a deſign in Hand, in which if he plaid his Part, he might with eaſe and ſafety raiſe his Fortune, and that he anſwered his Brother, he would uſe all lawful</hi>

                           <hi>means, and that he thereupon replied the means were not only Lawful but Meritorious, otherwiſe their Body and the cheif</hi> Catholics <hi>in</hi> England <hi>would not herein be concerned as now they were, whereupon this Informant ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, what he underſtood by his Brothers diſcourſe, and whether he did not underſtand that the Jeſuits and Papiſts had ſome Deſign against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, who anſwered he might well underſtand and ſuſpect they had ſome ſuch Deſign in hand; and thereupon this Informant again preſſed him to make a full diſcovery to the Councel when he came to</hi> London, <hi>if his Evidence were judged material: And this Informant told him, that he held himſelf bound in Conſcience to Diſcover all that he heard from him, if he omitted to do it himſelf, urging that his Evidence would at leaſt-wiſe be fortifying to others Testimony; and this Informant very well remembers, that coming about a week afterwards with Mr.</hi> Robert Jeniſon <hi>from Mr.</hi> Fenwicks <hi>Houſe at</hi> Beywel, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bowes <hi>met them, and drew Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>aſide, and diſcourſed Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>ſometime, after which Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>ſingled out this Informant, and told him he believed his own Brother Mr.</hi> Thomas Jeniſon <hi>would be hanged, and ſeveral other Perſons of Quality, who were concerned in this horrible Deſign, thereupon this Informant asked why? Who anſwered a handful of Jeſuits could not carry on ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign without the aſſiſtance of Perſons of Note and Power, and the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt be in, becauſe of his Purſe, and he believed the Plot was U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal becauſe his ſaid Brother had told him the greateſt</hi> Catholics <hi>in</hi> England <hi>were concerned in that Deſign, wherein he would have had him to have plaid his part, declaring, he had reaſon to believe it was to deſtroy the King and Government, whereunto this Informant replied, can you ſwear it, who anſwer'd I will not ſwear it now, and therefore this Informant repied Will and Can, are two things; Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>further added he was once in Company of five or ſix Jeſuits, and that all their diſcourſe was then tending to the deſtruction of the King and the Government, all agreeing to the ſelf ſame end but himſelf, but that he had not contradicted them in regard he was Young and Inferiour in Scholarſhip; and this Informant asked him what he meant by Perſons of Note and Power engaged in the Plot, he anſwered, the cheifeſt</hi> Catholics <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>but would name none, ſaying, in a Paſſion, do you think I am Privy to it, but added by God they will have about with the Duke; whereby this Informant believed there was a Helliſh Plot, and that the greateſt</hi> Catholics <hi>of</hi> England <hi>were in it, and that Mr.</hi> Robert Jeniſon <hi>knew more of it than he did at any time lay open, and this Informant ſpeaking ſomething of the Popiſh Emiſſaries engaged in the Plot, meaning Jeſuits and Monks, Mr.</hi> Jeniſon <hi>asked him, whether he was not a Popiſh Emiſſary? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this Informant replied no he did abhor the Name, and that</hi>

            <p>There are in this Information ſeveral things worthy of your Obſervation in this Evidence of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and if you will caſt but thoſe Orient eyes of yours upon this Account given in upon Oath, and not glout upon it, as the Devil did upon the Chimney Sweeper, but let it have your gracious Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This account ſtrongly Corroborated Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> Teſtimony, for all theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes paſt between this Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> whileſt <hi>Jeniſon</hi> was a Papiſt, before ever he entertained a thought of changing his Religion, or telling his knowledge of your Plot, and truly after this, that Man muſt be impudently incredulous, that would not believe Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in Town in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and at that part of the Month to which I did Swear, ſince Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> that converſed with him, had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many Credible Witneſs within ſo few days after, and that which is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, all this was declared to his Father, Siſter, and Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> when that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any Man alive, could apprehend that ever there would be an occaſion of bringing that Matter in doubt, and the Controverſie upon the Stage, this being ſo pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inly made out, none but ſuch a Bigot as your ſelf, and your raſcally Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would either endeavour to perſwade the World to queſtion the Truth of this Conſpiracy, or to give Credit to your villainous Party in any thing they ſay, nor could there be a greater Evidence of that Plot to deſtroy our religious Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, then that rather than their Deſign ſhould miſcarry, they would Sacrifice their Souls and Conſciences in the Juſtification of a moſt palpable Lye; but the Truth is they had a Vertuous King, and a Pious Duke to ſave, and rather then they would Expoſe them, they would venture their eternal State on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though you had wedded your ſelf to that faction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Synagogue (the Jeſuits I mean) yet they never forgave your appearing a Proteſtant, for they were

reſolved upon your Ruin as ſoon as they had fixed their buſineſs, and had ſettled the <hi>French</hi> intereſt and power, unleſs you would to all intents and purpoſes go through with them in thoſe Deſigns of theirs, that might tend to the fixing of their Religion upon ſuch a ſure Foundation, as ſhould not be in the Power of any number of Men to deſtroy, and in good ſooth Landlord, you was reſolved to keep pace with theſe Villains, rather than you would hazard the deſtroying an old rotten Carcaſe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remiſneſs in obeying the commands, and following the Councels of your Ghoſtly Hell-born Crew.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That your Proſecution of me for Perjury upon that Point was moſt illegal and unjuſt, and could never have been contrived againſt an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, but by a parcel of Villains, that valued neither what they ſaid or ſwore, and incouraged by your ſelf, that had vowed a revenge againſt me for diſcovering and breaking the neck of ſo fair a Deſign, in which you and they were ingaged, but God hath pretty well rewarded you for your Grace and Favour to me in that point in this World, what he may do in the next he knows beſt; you would do well to ſit down; and conſider with your ſelf the charge and pains you were at in that Affair, and if you would have turned but a Jew for half the Money with the help of your lewd Prieſt, that prates in the Neighbourhood of that Religion, you might have convicted me of being a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed <hi>Mahumetan.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Coleman</hi> accuſed you home for being Privy to the Correſpondency, that he held with <hi>Ferier,</hi> and <hi>Lachaiſe,</hi> and the Popes Internuncio, which all the World muſt conclude was Trayterous enough, nay though the two laſt years were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezled, yet thoſe that were found were ſo plain that when they were read, Sir <hi>John Whitelipps</hi> himſelf bepiſt his Breeches for fear, and had not one Word to ſay for his fellow intelligencer, and thought to have eſcaped upon the ſcore of his intereſt in you, but alas <hi>Coleman</hi> had ſo fairely brought you and <hi>Gammer Modena</hi> as partakers of his Crimes, inſomuch that had there been but Vertue enough in the Government, you muſt have mounted the Stage and have been made a partaker of his puniſhment.</p>

            <p n="6">6. That your Servant <hi>Coleman</hi> having held a long Correſpondency with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and finding that the Pence he Received did not anſwer his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he began to flag and complain of the ſame to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> but the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> was reſolved that <hi>Coleman</hi> ſhould not be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> writ to the Fathers of the Society, and complained of the ſlowneſs of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> of remitting Mony to <hi>England,</hi> and in the Letter to the Fathers of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> was one incloſed to Cardinal <hi>Howard,</hi> of which there was anſwer, that the Cardinal did not queſtion but that he ſhould obtain a good Penſion from the Pope for <hi>Coleman,</hi> and after ſome time did obtain the ſaid Penſion for honeſt <hi>Ned,</hi> and then he went on briskly and you know that at that very time your Pacquet went; a Copy of which <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communicated to the Fathers in <hi>London,</hi> which I had the opportunity of ſeeing, and it did farther appear to me by the conſtant Correſpondence that they held with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> at St. <hi>Omers</hi> in the Year 1675, 76, 77, 1678. that he had been a great ſupport to <hi>Coleman</hi> in thoſe his Correſpondences with the General of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Lachaiſe.</hi>

            <p n="7">7.

            </p>
            <p>LORD <hi>PETRE.</hi> I could have put you in mind of ſeveral other paſſages, relateing to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> but they were not very materiall, and ſo I let you paſs for the preſent, and come to this noble Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> who was not a man of ſuch Contemptible parts, as ſome men would make him, he was much of your own Standard, both as to Courage and Cunning, and therefore as ſit to engage with the Jeſuits to deſtroy your Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> as your ſelf

and he might as well ſerve for a Lieutenant Generall, and to as much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe too; under the Banner of the <hi>French</hi> King, as ever you ſerved under the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> differed onely from you in this Point, that where he did Eſpouſe a Cauſe, he never left it, as you did the intereſt of your Maſter the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that kept your Brother and you from Starving, and for his Recompence, your Brother and you Sold him into the Hands of the <hi>French</hi> King; but to the point in Hand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Lord <hi>Petre</hi> was conſtituted one of the Lieutenant Generals of your Popiſh Army, the Patent I ſaw in Mr. <hi>Langhorn's</hi> Chamber in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1678. and in the Month of <hi>June</hi> the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> received this Commiſſion; and I heard a Prieſt, whoſe Name was <hi>Langworth,</hi> wiſh him much Joy of the ſaid Commiſſion, and this <hi>Langworth</hi> was Prieſt in the Houſe of the Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> and was of the Order of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and at the Conſult at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> where the grand Conſult was held in <hi>April</hi> 1678. And you planted <hi>Langworth</hi> in the Lord <hi>Petre</hi>'s Houſe, as you had Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> in the Houſe of the Lord <hi>Powis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> was privy to that Conſult; for this <hi>Langworth</hi> gave the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> an exact Account of the ſaid Conſult in my own Hearing, and that <hi>Coleman</hi> had another to ſhew you; and I ſuppoſe honeſt <hi>Ned</hi> would not be behind hand of letting you know how the World did ſwing, and he ſwung for it to your great Joy: So the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> had the ſame Account from his Prieſt, that you had from your Secretary, in theſe Particulars. 1. That <hi>Cazy</hi> was ſent from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that this <hi>Cazy</hi> was a ſubſtantial Man fit for Buſineſs. 2. That <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Groves</hi> were appointed to kill the King, and the ſaid <hi>Langworth</hi> telling the Reward that <hi>Pickering</hi> was to have, <hi>Petre</hi>'s laught heartily, and ſaid, That a little ready Mony would not have been amiſs. And alſo telling the Reward that <hi>Groves</hi> was to have ſaid, It was too little for ſuch a conſiderable piece of Service; but ſaid, If they like it I do, But this I ſay, That I know <hi>Groves</hi> to be a ſtout Fellow. But in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole Story, the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> was for poyſoning the King as the more ſafe way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That by your Direction the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> kept ſeveral Men in Pay, which were to be ready to joyn in with the <hi>French,</hi> when ever they ſhould Land; and that <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Plimouth</hi> were in ſafe Hands, in Men that were the avowed Friends of the French King, and your ſelf; and <hi>Petre</hi> did agree with <hi>Langworth</hi> and the Conſul, who ſaid, That they had expected long enough, and could no longer bear his Uſage of them; for he had put many Things upon them, which he had promiſed to the contrary when he was at <hi>Bruxels:</hi> And the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> did ſay, That he thought the Fool would have more Wit when he came in.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> did ſay, That notwithſtanding he had received 10000 <hi>l.</hi> from you, yet he had expended 3000 <hi>l.</hi> more than ever he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that he expected that he ſhould have received more from you; for that you had received 300000 <hi>l.</hi> from the French King twice told, and that he could not continue your Men upon Pay without Money; and that you had
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95393:80"/>
put him off to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> who would acquaint him with the Pacquet that Sir <hi>Henry Titchburn</hi> had brought both from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> But when the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> diſcourſed him about them, and having received no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from the Lord <hi>Arundel, Petre</hi> preſſing the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> with too much Importunity, he huſſ'd him the Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> and called him Fool, and asked him what he would have; and this the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> took as a great Affront, and complained of it to your ſelf, and all the Anſwer he received from you was, That the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> was a great Man, and was old, and that you could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> to nothing but Patience, and in due time all things would be accommodated to the Lord <hi>Petre</hi>'s Content; and withall told the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> that he muſt obey the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi>'s Directions, the French King put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting great Truſt in him, and the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Belaſys.</hi> This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was at the Lord <hi>Petre</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Covent Garden;</hi> and thus far the Lord <hi>Petre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LORD <hi>BELASYS.</hi> Thus the World may ſee what a Creature of yours the Lord <hi>Petre</hi> was: But like to like, as the Devil ſaid to the Collier, you were not at all unequally yoked; and I having refreſhed your Memory concerning him, let me give you a touch of the Lord <hi>Belaſys,</hi> who was a Son of the Church to all Intents and Purpoſes, not of the Church of <hi>England</hi> but of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> your own Church, and of the ſame French Intereſt; ſo that your Expectations of his Truth and Fidelity to your Deſigns was not without Ground. This Lord having ſignalized himſelf in your Service, eſpecially in this ſecret Part of it; for you muſt know there is ſecret Service, as well as publick Service, that great Men expect from their Admirers and Followers; or elſe that worthy Lady Mrs. <hi>Po—</hi>would have ere this time been very uſeleſs in her Generation. But to the Point in hand.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Belaſys</hi> was deeply ingaged with you, and your Jeſuits, in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Conſpiracy; and that did appear to me, becauſe that he in <hi>Feb.</hi> 76. did write Letters to the Fathers at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> in which he gave an Account, That <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King had, by <hi>Lachaiſe</hi> his Confeſſor, made a Promiſe of 300000 <hi>l.</hi> provided that upon the Payment of the Money, <hi>Hull, Portſmouth,</hi> and <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> might be delivered up to him; which you know was a Sum that was diſtinct from that 300000 <hi>l.</hi> that you received for the raiſing of your Popiſh Forces: So that if you had complied with your Promiſe, you would have made the <hi>French</hi> Maſters of Four of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Places of this Realm. This Lord <hi>Belaſys</hi> did farther acquaint the ſaid Fathers, That he was recommended to them as a Perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it to take Arms, and did aſſure them, that his own Intereſt, and the Intereſt of his Family, ſhould be at their Devoir; and that he would ſpend the beſt Bood he had to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the World, that he had ſome Religion; and that if Things had been in ſo fair a Poſture when he was Governor of <hi>Tangier,</hi> that he would have delivered it up to the French King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lord <hi>Belaſys</hi> took a Commiſſion from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> granted by <hi>Johannes Paulus d'Oliva,</hi> General of the Society, by Virtue of a <hi>Breve</hi> from the Pope; which Commiſſion I ſaw in Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Chamber about <hi>April</hi>

or <hi>May</hi> 1678. and it was to be General of your Popiſh Army; and on the Month of <hi>July</hi> he was pleaſed by a Letter to acquaint <hi>Fenwick</hi> of his receipt of the ſame, and in that Letter he gave the Fathers of the Society freſh Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his anſwering their Expectations, and that you was pleaſed to expreſs your great Satisfaction, that the Lord <hi>Belaſys</hi> was made choice of for that Work. And in the ſaid Letter he tells us, That you were pleaſed to aſſure him, that as ſoon as the Peace was concluded, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would bend all his Forces for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in order to ſubdue Hereſy and Schiſm; and that the Engliſh Forces already raiſed, and the Catholick Forces that would appear upon the Landing of the French Forces, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Point in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That in the Month of <hi>July</hi> 1678. your Servant St. <hi>Coleman</hi> did acquaint the Fathers that were left in <hi>London</hi> in the Abſence of the Provincial <hi>Thomas Whitebread,</hi> who was then beyond the Seas, did attend the Lord <hi>Belaſys</hi> from you to acquaint him, That you thought it neceſſary that Money ſhould be ſent down into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and <hi>VVorceſterſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire, &amp;c.</hi> to draw up the Roman Catholicks to be here in Town with all ſpeed, that they might be ready againſt the Time of the Landing of the French Forces; and that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould go to their Catholick Tenants, and pay them Money to bear their Charges up to Town, that they ſhould receive from the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from my Lord <hi>Belaſys;</hi> and you may remember that it was the main End of <hi>Stafford</hi>'s going round the Country that Summer.

            <p>There is another of your Rogues (tho' I confeſs he is not worth naming) and that is <hi>Baltimore;</hi> he is an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord, and your Father made his Father Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Maryland;</hi> and as you are at this day King of <hi>Noland,</hi> ſo he is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Noland.</hi> That Villain of a Lord received a Commiſſion for a Troop of Horſe, for he was ſo mean that nothing could be meaner in the Eyes of your whole party; I remember upon diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot he fled for the ſame and was not examined, no not ſo much as at <hi>Feverſham,</hi> for he had Ballaſt enough, and ſo eſcaped the Catechiſing Bout you met with all, I thinke he lives at preſent without being remarkable for any thing but Kidnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping my Kinſman to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> who tho' his Father Mr. <hi>Rozer,</hi> deſired that he might be bred a Proteſtant, yet he was by him Perverted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is high Treaſon, and I hope the Government will reckon with him for it in due time.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs Sir, to refreſh your Memory with a ſmall Touch upon your <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and other Aſſaſſins, which were alſo heartily engaged with you in this ſoul Conſpiracy againſt our Religion and Government, and the Life of your Brother: Come lets have a little Patience exerciſed, and conſider with your ſelf, that they were Men that deſerved well from you, and worthy of your remembring their good Service; they did all they could though you left them in a decent way, ſo that they were fairly hanged for their Pains, they had taken in your ſecret Service; and ſince they met with a convenient Reward for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95393:81"/>
their great and mighty Works: Come Sir, you may ſee that there were more that were working beſides you, and <hi>Coleman</hi> and the French King they were Labourers in your Harveſt Field; let us ſee how they carried themſelves, and indeed upon the conſideration of their Behaviours, you may make a Review of your own, for you had not ſo much as one ill Quality in you, but they made it theirs, and they had not one Roguiſh Deſign but you were Maſter of it; I will not charge you with lifting up your Eyes and Hands, and wiſhing the Deſign of your Brothers Murder good Succeſs, as <hi>Langhorne</hi> did, but ſince he ended his days ſo Strangely, and none called to an Account for it, no, not ſo much as the <hi>Virago</hi> that gave him the deadly Doſe; What can any Man ſay for you in this Caſe? I muſt tell you again of Dr. <hi>Short,</hi> had he been ſuffered to live he could have told a lamentable Story; but he was ſent to tell his Tale in another World; and 'tis well known that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and you had not Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſtay the Ordinay courſe of Eſtabliſhing Popery and Arbitrary Power; and they notwithſtanding you were not Wiſe enough, yet they found in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of your Zeal you were willing to ſerve their turn, and had at laſt engaged to ſerve them upon the moſt Villanous Terms that ever Man could imagine, and though you were neither capable of giving or receiving Advice, yet you had the Gift to Pick your Noſe and ſay nothing, and let them Play the Game as they lifted, and when they were ſtrengthened by your Intereſt, and the French Kings Power, they could ſend you Trudging into the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as you did your Brother: But to come home to your <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, let me put you in mind that upon the fifth of <hi>April</hi> we had notice from <hi>Thomas VVhite</hi> and the Fathers in <hi>London,</hi> that a General Conſult was to be held on <hi>April</hi> the <hi>24th,</hi> and the Fathers of <hi>Leige,</hi> and <hi>Ghent,</hi> and <hi>VVatton,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers</hi> were ordered to attend the ſaid Conſult, and the Summons was to this effect; Thus all that had <hi>Jus Suffragij</hi> was to be there, and that they were not to haſten to <hi>London</hi> long before the time appointed, nor to appear much about the Town till the meeting was over, leaſt occaſion ſhould be given to ſuſpect the Deſign, and Secrecy as to the time and place was much Recommended to all thoſe that were Summoned, as it would appear of its own Nature neceſſary; this was the Summons, and to this Summons we all obeyed, and to <hi>London</hi> we came and there met about 50 or 60 of the Society from all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who (before the Conſult was diſolved) did reſolve upon the Death of the King, either by Shooting, Poyſoning, or Stabbing; <hi>Conyers</hi> the Benedictin was pitcht upon, and four <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ruſſians to Stab him, and <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> were pitcht upon to ſhoot him, and Sir <hi>George VVakeman</hi> to Poyſon him; thus your Brothers death was reſolved upon, and what they could not effect in 1678, they did in 1684, and to this of 78, your Servant <hi>Coleman</hi> was not only Privy too but was aiding, and adviſing, and conſenting, and how could you be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it then? For what you did in 1684 you had long deſigned, of which Sir, no doubt in the leaſt can be made, and therefore its in vain for you or any of your Villains to diſpute it, can you deny that you ſought the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> whilſt he was in that Station, only becauſe he had Married your Daughter; can you or your Brother of <hi>France</hi> deny that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts were to have your Aid and Power to ſubdue the Northern <hi>Hereſy?</hi> Can
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95393:81"/>
you deny that <hi>Coleman</hi> laboured for a Peace, that the French King might be at leaſure to aſſiſt you here in <hi>England?</hi> And that you might not have one to hand a Party againſt you; was not the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> kept under the Hatches by you and your Party? And was not the Parliament to be diſolved? And by the Diſſolution of the Parliament a Peace could be procured upon more Advantageous Terms to the <hi>French,</hi> and in order to your regaining your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Intereſt, which was hurt by quitting the Office of Lord High Admiral, it was contrived that you ſhould be reſtored, and that the King your Brother ſhould put the Fleet into your Hands as the only Perſon that could give a good account of it; and farthermore that for all the Places of importance of the Kingdom put into his Hands, till the Popiſh Religion and Arbitrary Power was fixed, and you at the Hand of it, in which Poſt you were to be but a Royal Tool to ſerve their baſe Ends and Purpoſes, and if you did not comply they knew how to diſpoſe of you, even in no worſe way than they deſigned upon your Brother, which I ſay (through Gods Mercy to <hi>England</hi> and your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency) they did effect, and then Popery had but two Legs, whereas in his time ſhe had four ſuch as they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> That it was objected againſt me, that I was not in Town in the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> this was one main Objection againſt my Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and to this end the Jeſuits produced a Number of raſcally Boys from St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> to prove my being there thoſe Two Months, nay, ſome of them Swore from <hi>December</hi> till <hi>June.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to anſwer this Objection, I brought in Seven or Eight Witneſſes to prove my being in Town, which gave the Court great Satisfaction. 1. The firſt Witneſs I called was Mr. <hi>Walter,</hi> ſometimes Vicar of <hi>Rainham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> who did declare that he had known me ſeveral Years, and had met me in <hi>Newgate</hi> Market; and in the Month of <hi>April</hi> he ſaw me in a Diſguiſe in a grey Serge Coat, and a grey Hat; at the firſt Sight this Miniſter did not know me to be the Man, but upon due recollection he found me to be the Man that he had ſeen; and to confirm his Judgment in it, he went to a Gentlewoman whoſe Name alſo he did not know, he went to her becauſe he had ſeen me at her Houſe, to enquire of her what was become of me, and how I did; and the Gentlewoman, not knowing the End of my going beyond the Seas, anſwered him thus; <hi>Oh,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>he is an undone Man, he is turned to the Church of</hi> Rome, and Abſconds and hides himſelf I know not where; <hi>Can all this be true?</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> told her, That he had ſeen me later than ſhe had done; for he had ſeen me the Day before, at the upper end of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Lane near <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Houſe. 2. <hi>Sarah Ives</hi> was another Witneſs in the Caſe, to confirm what Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> had ſaid; this was the Woman of whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired concerning me, who owned ſhe had not ſeen me, but my Friends had told her that they judged me about the Town <hi>Incognito;</hi> and ſhe proved that <hi>Walter</hi> had the aforeſaid Diſcourſe with her concerning me, and that he had told her that he had ſeen me the Day before; and ſhe tells you a particular Token, That my Father came then unto her Houſe to ſee her, and ſhe did ask my Father to eat ſome thin Cheeſe that was newly come in, and the firſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95393:82"/>
ſhe had come in; and ſhe enquired of my Father when he did ſee me, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told her, That he had not ſeen me of late; then, ſaid ſhe, I can tell you News of your Son; here was one Mr. <hi>VValter</hi> in my Shop that ſays he met him in <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Fields, but in a Diſguiſe, and that he had told her what Habit I was in. 3. A third Witneſs that proved me in Town at that time was one <hi>Butler,</hi> that was Coach man to Sir <hi>Richard Barker,</hi> who ſaid, That he was about his Coach which ſtood in the Gate-way, and that I came in, and asked him whether Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> was within, and he anſwered, No: At the firſt Sight he did not know me, by reaſon of the Diſguiſe that I was in, but had known me well before, becauſe that I wore a Miniſter's Habit, as I did then at the Tryal of the Jeſuits; but upon calling to mind who I was, he did bid me wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come into <hi>England</hi> again, but he ſaid I took no notice of him, but went on forward into the Houſe: But I made but little ſtay in the Houſe, becauſe a young Fellow had affronted me for the ſake of the Habit I was then in, and this he ſwore was in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1678. and that ſome time after he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Maſter with my being there in this ſtrange Habit. 4. The fourth Witneſs was <hi>Cicily Mayo,</hi> who depoſed that ſhe had never ſeen my Face before that time ſhe ſaw me in a Diſguiſe; and had not taken Notice of me then, had not a young Fellow, that was a Servant to Sir <hi>Richard Barker,</hi> told her that my Name was <hi>Oates;</hi> and ſhe having heard of my Name in the Family, ſhe did take the more notice of me, and came to viſit me after I was in <hi>VVhitehall,</hi> and ſhe ſaid that it was about a Fortnight before <hi>VVhitſontide.</hi> 5. The fifth Witneſs was <hi>Philip Page,</hi> another Servant of Sir <hi>Richard Barker,</hi> who alſo depoſed, That he ſaw me at Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Houſe in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1678. and that I was in a light-coloured Campaign Coat; this he did prove by this material Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, That his Maſter had a Patient at <hi>Iſlington</hi> at that time that was Sick of a Fever. 6. Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> himſelf was called, but he depoſed, That he did not ſee me till <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> but that his Servants had acquainted him that I had been there in <hi>May;</hi> that they had ſeen me in Two ſeveral Diſguiſes, at which the ſaid Sir <hi>Richard</hi> wondered very much. 7. There was one <hi>Smith,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a School-maſter at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> that did depoſe, That he ſaw me the firſt Monday in <hi>May</hi> 1678. and that we dined together. 8. The eighth and laſt Witneſs was Mr. <hi>Clag,</hi> an old Romiſh Prieſt, who (notwithſtanding he was of your Church) thought it his Duty to tell the Truth, and he depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That he ſaw me at Mr. <hi>Charles Howard</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Arundel</hi> Houſe; but <hi>Charles Howard</hi> was ready to confront Mr. <hi>Clag,</hi> but <hi>Howard</hi> was baffled being taken in a Lye, to which he would have ſworn, and did afterwards at another Tryal againſt me: But I had ſaved the Villain from the Gallows, and he made good the old Proverb <hi>in Omnibus; Save a Rogue from the Gallows and he will be the firſt that ſhall cut your Throat.</hi> But when moſt of theſe Witneſſes were dead, then you brought over your St. <hi>Omers</hi> Boys, and having Four Villains that were Judges, and Twelve Profligate Forſworn Rogues, Murtherers, that were Jury-men, you obtained a villanous Verdict againſt me; and to the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Men, theſe Rogues called themſelves Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Engliſh-men. But I have ſeen the End of ſome of them, and I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95393:82"/>
queſtion not but the Righteous God will avenge my Cauſe, notwithſtanding the unjuſt Judgment of your Villains pronounced againſt me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Another main Objection that was againſt my Teſtimony, was that which did relate to Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in Town in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>September:</hi> And this was poſitively proved by <hi>Sarah Pain,</hi> that he was in Town when ſhe went to live at my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi>'s, and that was a Week after the King went to <hi>VVindſor,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678. and that ſhe ſaw him Eight or Nine Days before, and the King went to <hi>VVindſor</hi> on the Thirteenth, and about the Twentieth ſhe went to live with the Lord <hi>Arlington;</hi> and ſeeing <hi>Ireland</hi> Eight or Nine Days before, it muſt be then about the Eleventh or Twelfth, which was the time I depoſed. And your Villains the Judges, Seven Years after, tryed me upon that Point; and they had packt a Jury of notorious Villains that was to do the Jobb, and they convicted me, for <hi>Sarah Pain</hi> was not to be found; and Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> he who ſwore <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in Town the Nineteenth, was forced to fly; ſuch was your Rage againſt thoſe who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your villainous Conſpiracies againſt the Nation, and the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties thereof. So that I was miſerably cruſhed by you; but a Parliament gave me this Vote, <hi>Reſolved, That the Proſecution of</hi> Titus Oates <hi>upon Two Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Perjury in the Court of King's Bench, was a Deſign to ſtifle the Popiſh Plot; and that the Verdicts thereupon given were Corrupt, and that the Judgments thereupon were Cruel and Illegal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Another Objection that hath been made uſe of by ſome, Why the General of the Jeſuits was uſed to ſign Commiſſions for Civil and Military Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers? And why he diſpoſed the Dignities of the Church? And why ſhould not you or the French King rather have done it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> If <hi>Talbot</hi> and <hi>Coleman</hi> had been alive, they would have told you the Reaſon; Nay, truſty <hi>Dick,</hi> your Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> would not have mine'd the Matter. But ſince they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, ſome one way, and ſome another; and ſince I am the only Man that can give the World an Account of the Buſineſs, I muſt not hold my Peace. Therefore be pleaſed to remember,</p>
            <p>That when your Council at St. <hi>James</hi>'s had formed the Deſign which was in the Year 1673. they were at a great Loſs who ſhould be at the Head of it; they and you had agreed, that you ſhould not appear at the Head of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, (though you really was ſo;) and the Reaſon was this, That you might not be obnoxious to the Law, in caſe there ſhould at any time appear any one or more to diſcover this Intrigue of yours: But the main Reaſon was, they found you leaky, and therefore it was concluded that this great Affair ſhould be managed by one, or by a Number of Men, that could carry on a Deſign with that Secrecy that became the Nature of the Thing; and therefore that vain glorious Fool your Secretary was often chidden for his being too open in the Matter. You may remember that when the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Oſſery</hi> went for <hi>Holland,</hi> which was on the Tenth of <hi>November,</hi> the very Day after a Council was held at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and there it was concluded, That the French King ſhould be at the Head of this Deſign, and you approved of the Advice, and diſpatched away <hi>Richard Strange,</hi> a Jeſuit, to the French King,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95393:83"/>
with a Pacquet, and in Company with him <hi>Edward Mico,</hi> to preſs the French King to aſſume to himſelf a Power of granting Commiſſions both Civil and Military, to ſuch of the Engliſh Nobility and Gentry as were recommended by your ſelf, and your ſaid Council; and that he would by no means wave the ſame, leſt the Deſign ſhould ſink; for the Council thought it no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for you to appear in it. And the main Reaſon was, That you were obnoxious to ſeveral in the Houſe of Commons, who would purſue you with the utmoſt Vigour, if ever ſuch a Thing ſhould take Wind, and they find you at the Head of it. <hi>Strange</hi> and <hi>Mico</hi> waited Three Days, and they received no other Anſwer from your French King, than that he would conſider the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he received from you, and would anſwer the ſame in due time; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he took time till the middle of <hi>December,</hi> and then you received an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the French King, that it was no ways convenient for him to ingage in granting Commiſſions to any of the Engliſh Catholicks, nor could he aſſiſt them at the preſent, becauſe of the War he was then ingaged in againſt the Conſederate Princes; but when he had obtained a Peace, his Aid and Power ſhould not be wanting: And further he promiſed to pitch upon ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Perſon that ſhould appear at the Head of the Deſign, that ſhould pleaſe all Parties, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And this was the preſent Thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he ſhould appear very obnoxious to all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> if he ſhould ingage in that Particular: And in the Concluſion of the Letter, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed you, and your Council at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, not to be too haſty in preſſing on Things too far, till he was in a Condition to aſſiſt you.</p>
            <p>Upon the Receipt of this you di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al, That the Motion was very ſtrange, that it was worthy of Conſideration, and within a Month you ſhould have an Anſwer with that reſpect that became him to ſo great a Prince. Well, what was next? Truly when the Month was expired you had an Anſwer, That he had conſider'd of it, and that he found himſelf not only incapable of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95393:83"/>
doing you Service; but it would be very inconvenient for him to engage in ſuch a thing, for that the whole concern of the Society lay upon him, and he was Old and could not well do the Duty of his place; he approved of your Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of uſing the name of an indifferent Perſon, and therefore humbly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed you to find out ſome other Perſon, and he thought that ſome Prince Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal would be very fit to be applied to in ſuch a Caſe as that.</p>
            <p>You were much concerned at this Anſwer, and the Death of Father <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> who died in a ſmall time after, and you was in a great ſtrait what to do; but upon a Letter you received from the French King, you were much raiſed in your hopes that the Confederates would be brought to Reaſon, and that as ſoon as he had done with them, that he would puſh your Deſign on with all vigour; that he had great Thoughts of obtaining the Pope to ſubſtitute ſome Perſon of ote, Nthat ſhould be the Head of it, and that he himſelf would Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion his own Officers that ſhould be ſent to your aſſiſtance, that you ſhould have a ſufficient Force to do your buſines; in this Letter he acquainted you how unfaithful your Brother the King had dealt by him; a Copy of this Letter was given to the Fathers at <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Coleman;</hi> and I had the good fortune to ſee it when I came amongſt them; for by that time they had Tranſlated moſt of the Letters that paſſed between you and the French King, and entered them down upon their Books at large.</p>
            <p>You know that in the Yeare 1675 the <hi>French</hi> King made Choice of Father <hi>Lachaiſe,</hi> for his Primier Father Confeſſor, which whom he adviſed very much in Relation to the buſines he deſigned to puſh in <hi>England;</hi> and this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lachaiſe</hi> was the Man that was Tooth and Nail for carrying on the Work; in the Summer you and <hi>Coleman</hi> fixed a Correſpondence with him, and it was agreed that he ſhould have an Abſtact of the Correſpondency that you and <hi>Coleman</hi> had held with Father <hi>Farrier</hi> in his Life-Time; which was a bout three Years Correſpondence, which <hi>Coleman</hi> did to your great Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to the Satisfaction of your whole Council, and to whom you were alſo pleaſed to Write: This <hi>Lachaiſe</hi> was very Zealous to have the General of the Jeſuits Engaged, and Engaged the <hi>French</hi> King to Write to the then <hi>Pope</hi> to lay his Command upon the ſaid Father General, to undertake the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Commiſſionating the Offices both Civil and Military, yea and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical too; the Pope conſented, and the Father General was importuned by the Pope, but he deſired the Pope that his Age and great buſines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which he was engaged in relation to the Affairs of the Scociety might be conſidered; ſo it was put off till 1676, and the Pope preſſing the General very hard in the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1676, he undertook the Affair, and Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> was extremely diſpleaſed that he was not applied to for his Council in that Affair; but the Legantine Power, and the Archbiſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

was for doing that by Degrees which you would have done at once; and told <hi>Coleman</hi> further that till this Parliament had enabled him with a good Sum of Money, he could not put them off, and all the Ships that were taken whilſt it was in being would prove to be in Vain, and that it would be a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Employment for him and Friends, to make ſuch an Intereſt in the Houſe of Commons that he might have Money enough to ſubſiſt without them, than to employ himſelf in theſe Foreign Negotiations as would ruin all: But Poor <hi>Ned Coleman</hi> turned a Deaf Ear to this diſcourſe of your Brothers to him, not believing that the Gallows would have been his Fate. Well, you were now ſure of the General to whom you had recommended ſeveral, but you ſaw no Commiſſions appear, which put you under ſome concern, and Judged your ſelf ſlighted; but the Reaſon the General gave you that at preſent he had not received his Power from the Pope; then you preſſed the Pope both by Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Titchburn</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Howard;</hi> but it was 1677 till the General receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Popes Bull for that Work, and when the Bull was obtained then in the latter part of 1677, Commiſſions began to appear pretty rife, and in the year 1678 to the time the Plot was Diſcovered to your Brother, which was ſome little time before you went to <hi>Windſor.</hi> But to conclude this particular, obſerve 1. that you were not to appear a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the head of the Conſpiracy for fear of being Expoſed to the Parliament 2. that if the thing were Diſcovered, it ſhould appear an unprobable Story, and ſo not be Believed. 3 That your Allie of <hi>France</hi> might not Expoſe himſelf to the Princes of Chriſtendom. 4 That the General of the Jeſuits unwillingly engaged in the Affair of granting Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions. 5. That when he had undertaken the Province aforeſaid; the whole Body of Jeſuits were engaged in the Work. 6. And more cloſly Linckt to the Intereſt of the French King, their General being his Creature to all Intents and Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>8. What Credit the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot obtained in the Nation, this did not only obtain Credit in the Nation, but might have been of great uſe to <hi>Charles</hi> your Brother, and I am ſure it was very Fatal to you and your Party, but that which you ſneer at, were the Reaſons why the Witneſſes were ſo ill treated at Court, and were not beloved by your Brother; to this I muſt give you theſe two Anſwers,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Conceſſion, that is poſſible he might not be pleaſed to give that Credit to the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and therefore its true he did not give the Witneſſes that kind Treatment at Court the Nature of their Cauſe required, and there where four Reaſons for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your Brother was well acquainted with the new Government and the new Religion that was to be brought in, but you were not ſo Civil as to acquaint him with the Deſign that was againſt his own Life, ſo that when that part of your Deſign was Diſcovered, you almoſt prevailed upon your Brother not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this part of the Plot, becauſe that you had ſo freely acquainted him with all the other Part of your Deſign, and engaged him in it; ſo that he being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by you and your Party not to give Credit or at leaſtwiſe to own that he did believe that the ſelf ſame Party (with whom he himſelf was in a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95393:84"/>
ſhould have ſuch another Plot againſt his Life: the King your Brother was in the Deſign againſt the Religion and Government of the Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſold into an opinion that the Religion and Government thereof was inconſiſtant with Monarchy, as he told the King of <hi>Poland</hi> by old Sir <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book Lockrom Jaws,</hi> alias <hi>Mapleface quondam</hi> his Envoy then, and that Raſcal of a Book-Cutter had got ſuch a notion of the uniting of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I think it was as great an argument to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to prefer him, as well as the cheating of your dear Brother by reaſon of his excellent Talent in the work of Book-Cutting, and alſo at the deſtroying of the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon why the King your Brother might not bee inclined to give the Witneſſes that Credit and Reception they did deſerve, becauſe of his affection to the Popiſh Crew, tho I muſt tell you that had I been of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Council, I ſhould have given him this Advice, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he would have preſerved himſelf from a Conſpiracy, was obliged in Policy to have had an Eye upon thoſe for whom he hath done the greateſt Kindneſſes, rather than upon thoſe to whom he hath been unkind; for thoſe that were diſguſted they made not ſuch frequent Opportunities, nor ſuch eaſy Acceſſes to him as your favoured Villains had, and the Conſpiracy that was begun againſt his Life, was; by you and thoſe Popiſh Lords and Jeſuits that had been moſt familiar with him for was it not his own only Life that kept you from the three Kingdoms, and that you were in danger every day to turn your Party deſtroyed by the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, therefore it ſtood you in much ſtead to diſpenſe with the Sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, rather then your Negotiations with the Cardinal <hi>Howard,</hi> the French King, and Father <hi>Farrier,</hi> and Father <hi>Lachaiſe,</hi> and <hi>Oliva</hi> General of the Jeſuits, and the Popes Internuncio at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> nay with the Pope himſelf ſhould fall to the Ground, and you know that you found him but looſe in his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which was that of <hi>Rome,</hi> (if he had any at all) and that he had neither Reſolution nor Courage, nor Conſtancy, and Popery was the thing you now Reſolved upon, and Arbitrary Government, he was Privy to all this and liked the Project but would not run the hazard you did, therefore becauſe he was a Trotter only and not a Galloper, you were reſolved to deſtroy him, and to blind him ſo that he might not ſee your Deſign nor believe it, you and your Party urged this for a main Reaſon; his Affection to them and his laying ſo many Obligations upon them, was an Argument ſufficient to ſupport your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the Credit of the Witneſſes that appeared to accuſe them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the King your Brother was Swallowed up in the Pleaſures of his Luſts, he preferred the Amorous Glances of his Whores before the ſafety of the three Nations, who were moſt of them of the Popiſh Religion, and they having his Ear and his Heart, did much prevail with him to diſcountenance the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Popiſh Plot and the Diſcov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You know who it was that was acquainted with the Conſpiracy by Order from the King your Brother; and he was ſo far purſuing the Diſcovery, that he choſe rather to let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators have time enough to convey away their Perſon and their Papers, and Madam <hi>Remarkable</hi> was as diligent a caſt Whore as any in that Affair. 2. Your <hi>Italian</hi> Comrade you know made a viſit to the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and by that Opportunity many of the Traytors had an opportunity to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; as alſo when you was ſent to take the Air in that Country, you took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you ſeveral of your Villains. 3.

            <p n="2">2. I anſwer in the ſecond Place, that notwithſtanding the uſage the Witneſſes met withal from your Brother in private Capacity, as he was a Man Wedded to his Pleaſures, and very Obſequious to the Strumpets that were about him, yet do but obſerve what Credit the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> gave the Witneſſes, and that through the Power of Truth, and Energy that was in the Teſtimony they gave.</p>

                           </gap>nſult the Means of our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This bloody and reſtleſs Party, not content with the great Liberty they had a long time enjoyed, to exerciſe their own Religion privately among themſelves, to partake of an equal Freedom of their Perſons and Eſtates with your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, and of an Advantage above them, in being excuſed from chargeable Offices and Employments, hath ſo far prevailed as to find Countenance for an open and avowed Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for their Superſtition and Idolatry without controul in ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom. Great ſwarms of Prieſts and Jeſuits have reſorted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have here exerciſed their Juriſdiction, and been daily tampering to pervert the Conſciences of your Majeſty's Subjects; their Oppoſers they have found means to diſgrace, and if they were Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, or other Magiſtrates, to have them turned out of Commiſſion; and in contempt of the known Laws of the Land, they have practiſed upon People of all Ranks and Qualities, and gained over divers to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſome openly to profeſs it, others ſecretly to eſpouſe it, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Service thereof.</p>
                        <p>After ſome time they became able to influence Matters of State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and thereby to deſtroy thoſe they cannot corrupt: The Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance or Prorogation of Parliaments has been accommodated to ſerve the Purpoſes of the Party: Money raiſed upon the People to ſupply your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's extraordinary Occaſions, was, by the prevalence of Popiſh Counſels, imployed to make War upon a Protestant State, and to advance and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the dreadful Power of the French King, though to the apparent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of this and all other Protestant Countries. Great Numbers of your Majesty's Subjects were ſent into, and continued, in the Service of that King, notwithſtanding the apparent Intereſt of your Majeſty's Kingdoms, the Addreſſes of the Parliament, and your Majeſty's gracious Proclamations to the contrary. Nor can we forbear to mention, how that at the beginning of the ſame War, even the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> were made Inſtruments to preſs upon that State the acceptance of one Demand, among others, from the French King, for procuring their Peace with him, That they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the publick Exerciſe of the Roman Catholick Religion in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95393:88"/>
Provinces, the Churches there to be divided, and the Popiſh Prieſts to be maintained out of the publick Revenue.</p>
                        <p>At home, if your Majeſty did at any time by the Advice of your Privy Council, or of your Two Houſes of Parliament, command the Laws to be put in due Execution againſt Papiſts, even from thence they gained Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their Party, while the Edge of thoſe Laws was turned againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters, and the Papiſts eſcaped in a manner untoucht. The Act of Parliament enjoining a Teſt to be taken by all Perſons admitted into any publick Office, and intended for a Security againſt Papiſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Employment, had ſo little effect, That either by Diſpenſations obtained from <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſubmitted to thoſe Teſts, and held their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves, or thoſe put in their Places were ſo favourable to the ſame Intereſts, that Popery it ſelf has rather gained than loſt Ground ſince that Act.</p>
                        <p>But that their Buſineſs in hand might yet more ſpeedily and ſtrongly proceed, at length a Popiſh Secretary (ſince executed for his Treaſons) takes upon him to ſet a foot and maintain Correſpondencies at <hi>Rome</hi> (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with a Native Subject of your Majeſty's promoted to be a Cardinal) and in the Courts of other foreign Princes (to uſe their own form of Speech) for the ſubduing the peſtilent Hereſy which has ſo long domineer'd over this Northern World; that is, to root out the Proteſtant Religion out of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby to make way the more eaſily to do the ſame in other Proteſtant Countries.</p>
                        <p>Towards the doing this great Work (as Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was pleaſed to call it) Jeſuits (the moſt dangerous of all Popiſh Orders to the Lives and Eſtates of Princes) were diſtrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Out of theſe Councels and Correſpondences wus hatched that damnable and helliſh Plot, by the good Providence of Almighty God brought to light above Two Years ſince, but ſtill threatning us; wherein the Traytors, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of longer delay, reckoning the prolonging of your Sacred Majesty's Life (which God long preſerve) us the great Obſtacle in the way to the Conſummation of their Hopes; and having in their Proſpect a proſelyted Prince immediately to ſucceed in the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, reſolved to begin their Work with the Aſſaſſination of your Majesty to carry it on with armed Force, to destroy the Protestant Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a ſecond Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo with eaſe to arrive at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our Religion, and the Subverſion of the Government.</p>

                           <pb n="170" facs="tcp:95393:89"/>
When this accurſed Conſpiracy began to be diſcovered, they began to ſmother it with the barbarous Murther of a Justice of the Peace, within one of your Majeſty's own Palaces, who had taken ſome Examinations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
                        <p>Amidst theſe Distractions and Fears, Popiſh Officers, for the Command of Forces were allowed upon M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When in the next Parliament the Houſe of Commons were prepared to bring to a legal Tryal the principal Conſpirators in this Plot, that Parliament was first prorogued, and then diſſolved: The Interval betwixt the Calling and Sitting of this Parliament was ſo long, that now they conceive Hopes of covering all their past Crimes, and gaining a ſeaſonable Time and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of practiſing them more effectually.</p>
                        <p>Witneſſes are attempted to be corrupted, and not only Promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but of the Favour of your Majesty's Brother made the Motives to their Compliance: Divers of the most conſiderable of your Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects have Crimes of the highest Nature forged againſt them, the Charge to be ſupported by Subornation and Perjury, that they may be deſtroyed by Forms of Law and Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>A Preſentment being prepared for a grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> against your Majeſty's ſaid Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> (under whoſe Countenance all the reſt ſhelter themſelves) the Grand Jury were in an unheard of and unpreſidented and illegal Manner diſcharged; and that with ſo much haſte and fear, leſt they ſhould finiſh that Preſentment, that they were prevented from delivering many other Indictments by them at that time found againſt other Popiſh Recuſants. Becauſe a Pamphlet came forth weekly, called, <hi>The weekly Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Rome, which expoſes Popery (as it deſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>We acknowledg your Majesty's Grace and Care in iſſuing forth divers Proclamations ſince the Diſcovery of the Plot, for the baniſhing Papiſts from about this great City, and Reſidence of your Majeſty's Court, and the Parliament; but, with trouble of Mind, we do humbly inform your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,

that notwithſtanding all theſe Prohibitions great Numbers of them, and of the moſt dangerous Sort, to the Terrour of your Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects, do daily reſort hither, and abide here. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder theſe and other ſad Effects and Evidences of the prevalency of Popery, and its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, we your Majeſty's faithful Commons found this your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's diſtreſſed Kingdom, and other Parts of your Dominions labouring when we aſſembled.</p>
                        <p>And therefore from our Allegiance to your Majeſty, our Zeal to our Religion, our Faithfulneſs to our Country, and our Care of Poſterity, we have lately upon mature Deliberation propoſed one Remedy of theſe great Evils, without which (in our Judgments) all others will prove vain and fruitleſs; and (like all deceitful Securities againſt certain Dangers) will rather expoſe your Majeſty's Perſon to the greatest Hazard, and the People, together with all that's valuable to them as Men or Christians, to utter Ruin and Deſtruction: We have taken this Occaſion of an Acceſs to your Majesty's Royal Preſence, humbly to lay before your Majeſty's great Judgment and gracious Conſideration this moſt dreadful Deſign of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Popery, and, as a neceſſary Conſequent of it, all other Calamities into your Majeſty's Kingdoms. And if after all this, the private Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the ſubtle Accomplices of that Party and Deſign ſhould yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, either to elude or totally to obſtruct the faithful Endeavours of us your Commons, for the happy Settlement of theſe Kingdoms, we ſhall have this remaining Comfort, That we have free'd our ſelves from the Guilt of that Blood and Deſolation which is like to enſue. But our only hope, next under God, is in your Sacred Majeſty, that by your great Wiſdom and Goodneſs we may be effectually ſecured from Popery, and all the Evils that attend it; and that none but Perſons of known Fidelity to your Majeſty, and ſincere Affections to the Proteſtant Religion, may be put into any Employment, Civil or Military. That whilſt we ſhall give a Supply to Tangier, we may be aſſured we do not augment the Strength of our Popiſh Adverſaries, nor encreaſe our own Dangers.

                           <hi>That your Majeſty's Sacred Life is in continual Danger, under the Proſpect of a Popiſh Succeſſor, is evident not only from the Principles of thoſe devoted to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which allow, That an Heretical Prince (and ſuch they term all Proteſtant Princes) excommunicated and depoſed by the Pope, may be destroyed and murthered; but alſo from the Testimonies given in the Proſecution of the horrid Popiſh Plot, against divers Traytors attainted for deſigning to put thoſe accurſed Principles into practice against your Majeſty.</hi>

                           <hi>From the Expectation of this Succeſſion has the Number of Papiſts in your Majeſty's Dominions ſo much increaſed within theſe few Years, and ſo many been prevailed with to deſert the true Protestant Religion, That they might be prepared for the Favours of a Popiſh Prince, as ſoon as he ſhould come to the Poſſeſſion of the Crown: And while the ſame Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſts, many more will be in the ſame Danger of being perverted.</hi>

If this be not Demonſtration that the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot had an univerſal Credit over all <hi>England;</hi> I will never undertake to make any out for the future. And this I muſt ſay, That it is beyond Contradiction; no Man of Senſe ever ſtanding in Oppoſition to that which is as plain as the Sun ſhining at Noon Day: Therefore I will proceed in the tenth Place.</p>
            <p>10. The Judges of <hi>England</hi> gave it Credit.</p>
            <p>Let me put you in Mind of what Judge <hi>Scroggs</hi> ſaid at <hi>Irelands</hi> Tryal, in his Charge to the Jury, he ſaith thus, <hi>It is moſt plain the Plot is Diſcovered, and that by theſe Men that it is a Plot, and a moſt Villanous one, nothing is more plainer;</hi> and when the Jury had found <hi>Ireland, Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> Guilty, obſerve what he ſaid to them, <hi>you have done Gentlemen like very good Subjects and very Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> (that is to ſay,) <hi>like very good Proteſtants, and now much good may their thirty Thouſand Maſſes do them.</hi>

            <p>Again in the Tryal of the Five Jeſuits, he ſaith thus, <hi>This Gentlemans Blood lies upon you,</hi> (ſpeaking of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey) and ſome have being Executed for it, it muſt be yet further told you, that in what you did, you have given us a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of what you would do, we have a Teſtimony that for promoting your Cauſe you would not ſtick at the Proteſtants Blood; the Letter</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>that was found in Harcourts Papers, doth farther confirm</hi> Oats <hi>in all the great and conſiderable Matters that he ſays, that there was a Plot, and that that Plot was called by the name of a Deſign, which was to be keep Cloſe and Secret; This is an Evidence that cannot Lye.</hi>

               </gap>y in his Government, and might have been upon the Throne, and your head upon <hi>London</hi> Bridge, (for ought I know) but this I will ſay, your Villan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Party could never recover the blow they received by the diſcovery of that Plot, and it was the firſt and chief moving Cauſe of the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the bringing our King to the Throne, and delivered the Nation from Popery and Slavery; and notwithſtanding my ill Uſage I have received from unreaſonable Men, I ſhall not Repent of any thing that I have ſaid or done concerning the Teſtimony I have given, relating to the Villanous Rogues and Traytors therein concerned, and your Worſhip was the chief of thoſe never to be forgotten and never to be forgiven, I ſay, I ſhall not Repent though I have received the worſt of Villanous uſage from this beſt of Government and have been left to Starve, I having been now deprived of the greateſt part of my Penſion theſe five or ſix Years againſt all manner of Juſtice, to pleaſe one male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Rogue, who never did one good Act in all his Life unleſs it were to cheat the old Rogue his Father out of an Eſtate.</p>
            <p>2. I come to anſwer a ſecond Queſtion, and that to ſhew you to what end I made the diſcovery, and 1. The firſt Reaſon was that the Body of Mankind might be undeceived concerning your ſelf and Party, that the impudent Lies of your <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts made in your Praiſe and Commendation both as to your Religion, Royalty, and Love to the Nation might ſufficiently be laid open, ſo that they might not any longer deceive the People in that Point as they had done in the Doctrins of <hi>Paſſive-Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non reſſiſtance.</hi> 2. That the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be ſo awakned to provide in a legal way for its own ſecurity and the ſecurity of its Laws and Religion; for in Truth the Lethargy that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Nation then lay under, which amazed ſome thinking Men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged you and your vigilant Villains; for ſome thought that upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Gun-powder Treaſon, and upon the late Reſtoration of your Brother that the Popiſh Party had laid all their Deſigns aſide, but alas! they purſued their deſigns more induſtriouſly, ſince we were Curſed with your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Company and yours, than ever before; and your Red-Letter'd Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels had ſo ſtarted their Caſe, that there was no room left for a Retreat; and rather than you and they would miſs your Hopes, you were reſolved to ſtake your Lives and Fortunes and all upon a Venture. You had taken ſo much Pains in the forming your Deſigns that you were reſolved not to looſe your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and (thanks be to God) you did not looſe your Labour; for you are well rewarded with the pleaſant Air at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> where you may abide, till by the way of <hi>Avignon</hi> you may be obliged to trot to ſome other Place, where you may ſpend the Remainder of your admirable Life. Theſe two Reaſons are ſufficient to juſtify any Man's Ends in ſuch an Undertaking as this; and as for the Undertaking it ſelf to diſcover, I am only accountable to God, and my
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95393:94"/>
own Conſcience; though thus much I may ſay, That in complying with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her Worſhip and Service, I nor no Man elſe can juſtify himſelf, notwithſtanding the Righteouſneſs of thoſe Ends I propoſed to my ſelf in the Management of that Affair: And I therefore do tell you, I would have no Man to follow my Example, In doing Evil that the greateſt Good may come thereof. I do avow the Truth of my Teſtimony that I delivered; but, on the other hand, I diſavow all thoſe Principles that I pretended to hold and maintain, whilſt I was as to outward appearance in Communion with that deteſtable Strumpet; for I was in Judgment always a Proteſtant of the Reformed Religion, and by the grace of God, through Strength of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, I will Live and Dye ſo: This may ſatisfie you and all Men, of my Truth in the Diſcovery; and of my uprightneſs in the Delivery of my Teſtimony, and of my Sincerity in this charge I have given here againſt you and your Villanous Party, and had I not complied with your curſed Synagogue, I would not in any meaſure have come at the knowledge of thoſe things that I have formerly given in againſt the Criminals concerned in the Deſign, nor have acquainted the World and refreſhed your Memory with ſeveral Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, in theſe four parts that I have Written, that the Kingdom may both learn to watch againſt you and your Hell-born crew: therfore I haſten to a ninth Particular, propoſed in the management of this Article.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſhow you of what great uſe the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot might have been to King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond if he had managed himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Parliament, and the Patriots of the Proteſtant Religion. And that you ſhall ſee in theſe following Particulars. as</p>
            <p n="1">1. We had been rid of all the Court Whores, who by their Lewdneſs and Baſeneſs had drawn the Heart of the then King your Brothe from his People, which the Parliament plainly ſaw; and therefore were very unwilling to part with any Money, for to ſupply the vain and Exorbitant Expences of thoſe impudent Womem, who Conſumed the publick Treaſure of the Nation; as faſt or faſter than, then it could be given by Parliament; or rayſed and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected when given; and by this fair riddance of ſuch Carrion, the then King for ought I know might have enjoyed his Crown with Peace and Honour to this Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You had been Excluded from inheriting the Imperiall Crown of this Realm; which Excluſion had turned to a better Account to your ſelf then the being an humble Slave, and a pittifull Beggar, a Fugitive, and a Vagabond; but you by oppoſing the full Diſcovery of the ſaid Plot, and Conſpiracy carried on by you and your wicked Party; carried your Point againſt the ſaid Bill, by which, you was Emboldened in all and every of your wicked Practices againſt the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom; but you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in part the Wages of your abominable and unparalell'd Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and much good may they do you with all my Heart; I know no body that in the leaſt that envies your bleſſed State, and Condition, into which by the providence of God you have put your ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:95393:94"/>
3. The Nation had been diſcharged from the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, that mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prevailed in your Brothers Reign, to the great danger and damage both to the Strength, and Trade of the Nation, and the Laws, and Liberties, and Religion thereof; for as long as that Intereſt was Suppor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Rome</hi> Countenanced, it was impoſſible that <hi>England</hi> could be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Nation; or her Inhabitants a free People. This the Parliament long ſaw before your Plot was Diſcovered; and had your Brother incouraged the Diſcovery thereof, he had ſecured to himſelf the Glory of reſtoring to us our Liberties, and making himſelf a Terrour to all his Enemies both at Home and Abroad, but he joyning in the Conſpiracy, he became their Scorn and Contempt, and as his Reign was wicked, ſo his End was Miſerable.</p>

Your Popiſh Party might have infallibly been deſtroyed and Rooted out from being a People; but the ſaid King not joining with his Parliament, in making ſuch an improvement of the diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot did Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden that party to Exert it ſelf almoſt to the ruin of the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, and at laſt to Poyſon the King himſelf, to make way for you to Enſlave the Nation and Subjugate it to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>10. I now come to ſhow you how Fatal the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot was to your Popiſh Party, notwithſtanding the Villanous Uſage the Nation received from that Party of Men; by which it was much weakened both to its Strength and Wealth; yet the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot put a new Life into the honeſt Party, ſo that they became Unanimous to a high Degree; the Diſſenters that were then much Divided; did in a great Meaſure unite againſt the common Enemy, and joyned with the moderate Church Party, in order to Extirpate that Romiſh Hereſy that had ſo much inlarged its Borders; and the Eyes of all Men were ſo opened, that even in your Government Popery had been ſo maul'd, that it could not ſtand upon its Legs, notwithſtanding the many cordial Incouragments it had received from you and your mighty Allies in order to its recovery again: Nay the Princes of Chriſtendom have Joyned as one Man to deliver <hi>England,</hi> ſo that they themſelves, might not be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by you and your mighty <hi>Nimrod.</hi>

What you would ſay a Comfortable Word on the Behalf of your Popiſh Crew, and would have the World believe they were Innocent, and ſo you mump thoſe lockrom Jaws of yours; and in Speaking one Word in the Behalfe of your Rogues, you intend ten for your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Come ſpeak out Man, and tell us what you would have the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>England</hi> believe concerning the Innocency of your ſelf and Party; we have a Sett of high Church Proteſtant Whelps, that are blinded yet, as not to give the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot its due Credit; but they are a ſort of Vermine that are branded for infamous Rogues, and ſo it is no great matter what they ſay; but for the generality of Proteſtants they have received the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Popiſh Plot with Hearts that were thankeful both to God and their Deliverers: And let me tell you for all your Sneering, that our ſober

What would you make it morally impoſſible that they ſhould be ingaged in ſuch a Deſign as this?

true, for they fled to the King your Father either to be Protected by him or to betray him as old <hi>Simkin</hi> ſays he did you, but your Fathers Cauſe was bad en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, and if they did go in to ſerve him, it was like to like as the Devil ſaid to the Collier; but when they found his Intereſt ſunk, they like old Rats left the falling Houſe, and Contributed all they could (good Men) to haſten his bleſſed Memory out of the World, and joined in heartily with thoſe that Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Work; yet your Party were Netled, and ſay that it was impoſſible the Popiſh Plot ſhould be true, becauſe there were ſo many Perſons of Quality ſaid to be concerned in it, that had been moſt remarkable for their Loyalty to your Family; what a mighty wonder is here, that Perſons of Quality ſhould be engaged in a Plot. I would fain have you and your Ragged Mumping Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> tell me when there was a Plot carried on without Perſons of Quality, for Perſons of Quality are moſt capable by their Purſes and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to head Parties and Factions in a Kingdom; I pray when the <hi>French</hi> King offered to your ſweet ſelf the Aid of his Purſe and Credit to carry on the mighty work that you had upon your Hands, ſhould you have ſlighted that generous offer of his, and rather excepted of the offer of a Broommans Purſe and Credit in <hi>Kent-ſtreet,</hi> was not the French Kings Purſe a longer Purſe, and his Quality ſomewhat greater: I pray ask my Land-Lady when ſhe hath rubb'd you down, and ſee what an Anſwer ſhe will give you, come Sir, methinks you ſhould be able to anſwer this Queſtion, without making one ſilly Face at the buſineſs.</p>

O but they were Men of Vertue, and Integrity, and unblemiſhed Reputation! What their Reputation was I leave to the Nation that knew them; and what yours, among the reſt, all <hi>Europe</hi> knows: But this is certain, That a certain Popiſh Lord, yet alive, carried a Petition to the Lord Protector <hi>Cromwel,</hi> ſigned by above Five hundred Noble men and Gentlemen, in which they promiſed that great Man, that if he would procure them the Toleration of their Religion by a Law, they would, for his ſake, cut the Family of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> off, Root and Branch.

You and your Party may plead farther, and ſay, The World was told of ſeveral Commiſſions granted out by the General of the Jeſuites, for all Sorts of Offices both Military and Civil, but no treaſonable Papers, nor none of theſe Commiſſions, could ever be ſeen. <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have hit it, now I ſuppoſe you will be quiet in your Mind, and take an Anſwer that may become you to receive and me to give: It was on the Thirteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Plot was diſcovered to the King your Brother, 1678. and you and your Party had from the Thirteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> till the Twenty eigthth of <hi>September</hi> following, to burn and conſume all ſuch Papers and Commiſſions as might affect any one of you; and what you burnt of them you know beſt. But, Sir, when <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>'s Papers were ſeized, there were no leſs than Six Commiſſions ready ſealed, with Blanks to fill up with what Names they pleaſed, and they were bundled up with this Inſcription, <hi>R.

And this is another Reaſon why they were not made uſe of againſt the Jeſuits. What a Multitude of Cyphers <hi>Coleman, Ireland, Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Whitebread</hi> had, was much Amazing to your Brother; not that he was Amazed at their being in the Conſpiracy, but that they had not upon due Notice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, by your Brother and your ſelf, burnt them, or otherways made away with them: But found they were, and between you and <hi>Floyd</hi> they were ſtifled, in order to weaken the Proof of your Villanous Deſigns againſt the Life of your Brother, and the Religion, Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom.

only to the Proteſtant, but alſo to the Catholick Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and all others, both High and Low, Rich and Poor, Jew and Gentile, Bond and Free. How deteſtable you muſt be therefore to God, and all good Men, I leave it to your Conſcience to judg; but you have the Wages of your Villany, and I wiſh you all Joy of them.</p>
            <p>Well, how do you by this time? What think you of this Article? It is a Tickler I'll aſſure you, and it will ſtand you inſtead to deliver your ſelf and Party. Come, what have you to ſay for your ſelf, and Friends? If you had but a Grain of Senſe you would conclude, That you had lived too long, ſince You have out lived the Love and Piety you owed to the Conſtitution, and Laws of your native Country, by which it hath been ſupported theſe Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years; and therefore it was no wonder that your Government hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived you, and you moſt honeſtly ſent to graze at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> to behold the miſerable Eſtate of your Neighbours, to which you would have reduced us. And you hope, notwithſtanding all this, to be Recalled. Alas! good Man, when, I pray you? And by whom? And to what End? Anſwer any of theſe Three Queſtions if you can, and then you will do ſomewhat.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do you think that we are afraid of your Plotting, and making Parties? Cannot you ſee by this time that your Fools rather Plot as if they had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſire to be hanged, to prevent their Starving or Rotting in a Jayl, for the Debts they have contracted by their riotous lewd Living, than to reſtore you to the Three Kingdoms? For aſſure your ſelf they have applied to wrong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and made uſe of wrong Methods; by which means they are taken up for Hawks meat, and are hanged; though at the ſame time they are a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the very Gallows, and dye without any manner of Pity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do you imagine that Scotch <hi>Robin,</hi> by cheating my Lady <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> of her Husband's Books, may collect out of them Matter enough to perſwade the World, in his impudent Lying Pamphlets, that the Nation ought to reſtore you again? Or do you think that Scribling will ever bring you back, ſince a good Army could not keep you here? No; nor Sir <hi>John Knight</hi>'s Speech, which in Truth was bitter enough to have hanged the Raſcal, ſooner than gained one ſingle Vote for the Buſineſs. Nay, to give them their juſt due, I find that the Pens that in Times paſt were moſt buſy, now lie ſtill; which they would not do, if they thought Writing would do any good: Even the Writing of Scotch <hi>Robin</hi> hath been of as little Uſe as his Preaching.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Writing will not do, do you think that Prating may? Truly your Friend, Mr. Spit fire, hath made a fearful Noiſe many a fair Time; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is your Friend, or no, I cannot tell: If he be, ſurely you need to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to carry his Key about him, to let your Friends know his Meaning, for he is as dark as Mid-night; for my part I underſtand him not, nor do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Acquaintance, and I do not find that he hath made any Convert to your Intereſt. But to deal plainly with you, I doubt your Cattel are miſtaken

Well, you have Mr. Prate-a-pace, who glories much in the Name of a Whig <hi>Jacobite,</hi> he runs too and fro compaſſing the whole City, and tattles much for you; but I think he expoſes himſelf more than he can enlarge your Intereſt: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me to Rhiming <hi>Jack Carryl,</hi> ſince he hath loſt his Eſtate he may turn Ballad-Singer, it may be that may be of ſome uſe to you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Can you imagine that Eating and Drinking will do: I pray where is the ready Darby for to pay the Reckoning? Sir Sweet-face Tell-penny ſwears by his Book of old Penſioners that there is not a Shilling to be got, if you would cry your Eyes out; and ſo the poor Rogues muſt either hang, ſtarve, or ſell themſelves, and run away with the Money. Nay, Sir <hi>John</hi> Greazy-Guts ſwears by the Modeſty of his young Wife, and the Honeſty of Squire Bold-face his Neighbour, that your Friends muſt leave that way, it being only a Sparkiſh Frolick, and that therefore they muſt enter into a cheaper way of managing your Matters; for though theſe truſty Cards of yours cannot afford themſelves Shillings to ſwill it at a Tavern, yet they are willing to help them to a few Penny-wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch of Farthings to ſip at a Coffee-houſe, which will do as much good as <hi>Hodges</hi> Preaching at <hi>Sam</hi>'s to his Spiritual Auditors. And if you could maintain half a Score of theſe Fellows to run from Coffee-houſe to Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe, the World might be plagued with their Non-ſenſe, but they can never get one Line to recal you, though you have been graciouſly pleaſed to plant your ſelf within call theſe Eight or Nine Years: And therefore I know no call you will have, unleſs your Iriſh Underſtanding be called in queſtion for not putting a Period to your own wicked Life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do you think that Hanging up ſome of your Cattel might do you any Service? Truly then, Sir <hi>Simkin,</hi> your old Friend, if he will but exert his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, he can tell how to betray the poor Dogs; but what he will turn to do it there I am to ſeek, your Miniſtry may find ſome Expedient for this Work. And truly it might ſave your Friends before-mentioned ſome Charge, ſo that they be the better able to put a travelling Penny in your Pocket, when you ſhall make a Gracious Amble to <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſome ſuch Place. But now I think on't, there will not be any need of their being Betrayed; for the Rogues are pretty Pert, and ſince they canot ſerve you at their own Expence, they are reſolved to ſerve you their own way. Therefore let them take their own Courſe, without forcing them upon Secrecy in their own Defence: For as their Openneſs can do us little hurt, ſo their ambling from Coffee-houſe to Coffee-houſe, and picking up Scraps of News Papers, can do you little good.</p>
            <p>To conclude all this Memorial; You may ſee what a Sett of Villains you have uſed, and do ſtill imploy, to manage with and for you: And I think I have ſet you forth pretty well in your proper Colours; and if you will have

Patience I will give you another Caſt of my Calling: For I ſee you may well ſet a Fifth Time, and your Cloaths will not be the worſe for it on your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Back. And by that time I have finiſhed my Articles, the Nation may ſee what a Pretty Jewel we have had of <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York.</hi>

            <p>WHereas I <hi>Titus Oates</hi> Clerk, Doctor in Divinity, now of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Margaret Weſtminſter</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> did, in the Year <hi>1685.</hi> ſuffer Two Cruel and Barbarous Whippings, by which I lay Ten Weeks under the Chirurgions, and had little Hopes of being preſerv'd; but through the Mercy of Almighty God, and the extraordinary Skill of a Judicious Chirurgion, I out-liv'd that Barbarous and Inhuman Uſage. I do certify, That <hi>James Waſs,</hi> Citizen and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>London,</hi> was the Perſon that under God ſaved my Life, and none but he: For Application having been made to ſeveral of his Profeſſion, yet none durſt to appear to perform that peice of Service, for fear of the then Tyrannical Government, but he the ſaid <hi>James Waſs,</hi> judging himſelf bound in Conſcience to do his Duty in his Profeſſion. And I do hereby certify, he never had any Reward for that peice of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from me, nor have I been ever Capable of making him any Return for that peice of Service, and great Kindneſs to me, in ſaving my Life in that ſad Condition, under which I then laboured. And I do further certify, That the ſaid <hi>James Waſs</hi> did not only at his own Coſt and Charge perform the ſaid great Cure, but alſo reliev'd me in my Neceſſity, in a moſt bountiful Manner, and ſtir'd up ſeveral of my Friends to ſupply me with conſiderable Sums of Money, in the Time of my cloſe Confinement; and by reaſon of my hard Uſage in Priſon I had contracted much Sickneſs and Weakneſs, the ſaid <hi>James Waſs</hi> was always ready to attend me, without any manner of Reward, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his Medicines or Trouble of Attendance; and had not the ſaid <hi>James Waſs</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited me in Priſon, for ought I know I might have Periſhed for want.
